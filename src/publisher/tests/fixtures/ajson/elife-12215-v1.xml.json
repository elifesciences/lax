Using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task, we show that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. Intriguingly, categorization performance was markedly improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm. By using a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and the active sensor algorithm, we estimate that a major portion of this apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the central process of selecting fixation locations is around 70% efficient in our task. Our results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations."

Using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task, we show that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. Intriguingly, categorization performance was markedly improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm. By using a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and the active sensor algorithm, we estimate that a major portion of this apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the central process of selecting fixation locations is around 70% efficient in our task. Our results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations."

For example, in order to determine the gender or emotion from a face, we fixate around the eyes or the nose, respectively."

The model could also work out the next best fixation location that would maximize the amount of information that could be collected.

Furthermore, it suggests that the inefficiencies are largely caused by imperfect vision and inaccurate eye movements."

Indeed, in vision, the pattern of eye movements used to scan a scene depends on the type of information sought (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hayhoe and Ballard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rothkopf et al., 2007</a>), and has been implied to follow from an active strategy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Renninger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Navalpakkam et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nelson and Cottrell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Toscani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chukoskie et al., 2013</a>) in which each saccade depends on the information gathered about the current visual scene and prior knowledge about scene statistics. However, until now, studies of such active sensing have either been limited to search tasks or to qualitative descriptions of the active sensing process. In particular, no studies have shown whether the information acquired by each individual fixation is being optimized. Rather, the fixation patterns have either been described without a tight link to optimality (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballard et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Epelboim and Suppes, 2001</a>) or compared to an optimal strategy only through summary statistics such as the total number of eye movements and the distribution of saccade vectors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2008</a>) that could have arisen through a heuristic. Therefore, these studies leave open the question as to what extent eye movements truly follow an active optimal strategy. In order to study eye movements in a more principled quantitative manner, we estimated the efficiency of eye movements in a high-level task on a fixation-by-fixation basis."

In contrast, in many other tasks, such as constructing the meaning of a sentence of written text, or judging from a picture how long a visitor has been away from a family (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yarbus, 1967</a>), no single visual location has the necessary information in it and thus such tasks require more complex eye movement patterns. While some basic-level categorization tasks can be solved in a single fixation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Thorpe et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2002</a>), many situations require multiple fixations to extract several details at different locations to make a decision. Therefore, when people have to extract abstract information (eg., how long the visitor has been away) they need to integrate a series of detailed observations (such as facial expression, postures and gestures of the people) across the scene, relying heavily on foveal vision information with peripheral vision playing a more minor role (<a href=\"#bib24\">Levi, 2008</a>)."

As each individual patch of fur can be consistent with different animals, such as a zebra or a cheetah, and the foliage prevents the usage of gist information (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oliva and Torralba, 2006</a>), multiple locations have to be fixated individually, and the information accumulated across these locations, until a decision can be made with high confidence. For maximal efficiency, this requires a closed loop interaction between perception, which integrates information from the locations already fixated with prior knowledge about the prevalence of different animals and their fur patterns, and thus maintains beliefs about which animal might be present in the image, and the planning of eye movement, which should direct the next fixation at a location which has potentially the most information relevant for the categorization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Inspired by this example, and to allow a mathematically tractable quantification of the information at any fixation location, we designed an experiment with visual patterns that were statistically well-controlled and relatively simple, while ensuring that foveal vision would dominate by using a gaze-contingent categorization task in which we tracked the eye and successively revealed small apertures of the image at each fixation location. In contrast to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Renninger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Peterson and Eckstein, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Morvan and Maloney, 2012</a>), our task required multiple locations to be visited to extract information about abstract pattern categories."

Given current beliefs, different potential locations in the scene will be expected to have different amounts of informativeness with regard to further distinguishing between the categories, and optimal sensing involves choosing the maximally informative location (red). In the example shown, after the first two fixations (blue) it is ambiguous whether the fur belongs to a zebra or a cheetah, but active sensing chooses a collinearly located revealing position (red) which should be informative and indeed reveals a zebra with high certainty. Note that this is just an illustrative example."

Participants had to categorize each image pattern as patchy or stripy (disregarding whether a stripy image was horizontal or vertical\u2014the inclusion of two different stripy image types prevented participants from solving the task based on one image axis alone). The images were generated by a flexible statistical model that could generate many examples from each of the three image types, so that the individual pixel values varied widely even within a type and only higher order statistical information (ie. the length scale of spatial correlations) could be used for categorization. We first presented the participants with examples of full images to familiarize them with the statistics of the image types and to ensure their categorization with full images was perfect. We then switched to an active gaze-contingent mode in which the entire pattern was initially occluded by a black mask and the underlying image was revealed with a small aperture at each fixation location (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; for visibility, the black mask is shown as white). As a control, we also used a number of passive revealing conditions in which the revealing locations were chosen by the computer rather than in a gaze-contingent manner. In all conditions, we controlled the number of revealings on each trial before requiring the participants to categorize the image (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To ensure that participants had equal chance to extract information from all revealing locations in the passive as well as the active conditions we allowed the participants to rescan the revealed locations after the final revealing (see also Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for full rationale). Importantly, in the active revealing condition, even though rescanning was allowed after the final revealing, participants had to select all revealing locations in real time without knowing how many revealings they would be allowed on a given trial. Therefore, although rescanning could improve categorization it was unlikely to influence participants\u2019 active revealing strategy. To confirm this we also performed a control in which rescanning was not allowed (see below)."

To account for the translation-invariant statistics of the underlying images of a type, we used the relative location of revealings obtained by subtracting from the absolute location of each revealing (measured in screen-centered coordinates) the center of mass of the absolute locations within each trial (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). In order to compare eye movement patterns across conditions and participants, we subtracted the mean density map across all images for each participant.\u00a0Importantly, we found that the pattern of revealings strongly depended on image type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, first four rows). The pattern of eye movements for images of the same type were positively correlated for each participant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left, orange bars; p&lt;0.001 in all cases), whereas eye movements for images of different types were negatively correlated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left, purple bars; p&lt;0.001 in all cases). We also found that eye movement patterns became increasingly differentiated over the course of the trial as progressively more of the image was revealed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left, curves). The dependence of the eye movement patterns on the underlying image type shows that participants employed an active sensing strategy."

After the final revealing, participants rescanned only briefly, on average for 5.0\u2009s in the active condition, 6.4\u2009s in the passive random condition before making a decision. Moreover, their performance did not improve with increased rescanning time, instead it correlated negatively with rescanning time for 2 out of 3 participants, such that the probability of a correct decision for rescanning times at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the rescanning time distribution fell from 0.77 to 0.54 (p&lt;0.001) and from 0.77 to 0.66 (p&lt;0.03), respectively. This suggests that longer rescanning times indicate when participants are uncertain rather than providing the main source of information for their decisions. This is in contrast to additional revealings during the original scanning period which clearly benefit performance when chosen appropriately (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

To construct this model, we considered three sources of suboptimality: <i>prior biases</i> implying imperfect knowledge of the precise correlation length scales of each pattern category, <i>perception noise</i> that distorts the displayed pixel values, and <i>decision noise</i> which occasionally results in selecting the category with the lower posterior probability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Houlsby et al., 2013</a>). We fitted six models to the individual choices of each participant. These models differed in the kind of prior bias and decision noise they included, and we selected the model with the strongest statistical evidence, as quantified by the Bayesian information criterion (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). The best model (4 parameters in total) provided a close match to the participants\u2019 performance both in the active and passive random-revealing conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red and blue lines). Crucially, this model also allowed us to estimate the beliefs that participants held about image categories at any point in a trial, which was necessary for determining the optimal next eye movement that could maximally disambiguate between the categories."

This information-based measure is more robust than directly measuring distances between optimal and actual scan paths because multiple locations are often (nearly) equally informative when planning the next saccade. For example, in the trial shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the BAS score map was clearly multimodal for several fixations, and some of the participant\u2019s fixation locations were indeed distant from the corresponding locations that BAS would have chosen, yet their informativeness was generally very high.

As a more stringent control than a random strategy, we also simulated eye movement patterns for three heuristic strategies that reproduced different aspects of the statistics of participants\u2019 actual eye movement patterns but lacked the full closed-loop Bayesian interaction between belief updating and eye-movement selection (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). We first used a feed-forward strategy, which retained order-dependence, i.e. the way the statistics of revealing locations chosen by the participants depended on revealing number, but ignored participants\u2019 inferences about the category (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, orange). The second heuristic took into account the participant\u2019s belief about the underlying image, but not the revealing number (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, purple). The third heuristic was a partial closed-loop strategy, that thus respected both the belief- and order-dependence of revealings, but not the details of previous revealings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, brown line). Notably, this strategy would be optimal for simpler stimuli and tasks, such as visual search for a target, but not for our spatially correlated stimuli and task requiring information integration across multiple locations.

Indeed, this efficiency in information gathering was also reflected in our participants\u2019 performance when they viewed revealings generated by this ideal BAS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, black points). In this condition, participants only rescanned the revealed locations for a\u00a0short amount of time after the final revealing (average of 4.4\u2009s), less than in the active and passive random conditions, thus their increased efficiency could not be attributed to longer rescanning times. The discrepancies between participants\u2019 and BAS\u2019s revealings may be caused by participants employing an inefficient strategy to select their fixation locations, or, alternatively, they\u00a0may be due to more trivial factors upstream or downstream of the process responsible for selecting the next fixation, such as noise and variability in perception or execution, respectively. Importantly, when we computed the information gain provided by BAS when operating with participants\u2019 prior biases, perceptual noise and the typical saccadic inaccuracies as described above, the discrepancy between the informativeness of BAS-generated revealings compared to that of participants\u2019 revealings was markedly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, green lines, BAS/free-scan efficiency = 1.45, 95% CI, 1.37\u20131.53). This suggests that the central component of choosing where to fixate was around 70% efficient in our participants, and a large component of suboptimality arose due to other processes. To examine the role of learning in participants\u2019 active sensing strategy, we computed the relative efficiency of each of the free-scan sessions of our experiment, spanning multiple days, compared to the final session (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that efficiency remained stable over the whole course of the experiment, suggesting there was minimal, if any, learning required in the free-scan task."

In particular, our participants\u2019 eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy, and were about 70% as efficient as the optimal active sensor that operated with the participants\u2019 own prior bias, perception noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Importantly, this\u00a0estimate does not conflate the inference process with the selection process in that even if the participant\u2019s inference is biased or inconsistent, we can measure, given those beliefs, the extent to which they select fixation locations optimally. The 30% inefficiency we found may be due to unmodeled constraints in human eye movement strategies, such as the biases for cardinal directions or fixating the centre of an image that were apparent in our data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and that may also be beneficial in natural environments (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tatler and Vincent, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2009</a>). Such suboptimalities are conceptually different from those that we factored out using the specific biases and noise included in the BAS model. The latter are suboptimalities that arise in the execution of a planned saccade (as in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), while the former could be suboptimalities of the planning itself. Therefore, as we were interested in the degree of (sub)optimality of the planning component, we chose not to factor out potential biases for cardinal directions or locations. Should such suboptimalities turn out to be part of the execution process, then our estimate of 70% would become a lower bound on the efficiency of the planning process."

In one study, using a simple object localization task, it was found that the choice of fixation locations was close to random despite obvious learning of the underlying stimulus statistics (<a href=\"#bib12\">Holm et al., 2012</a>). In another study, using a simplified visual search task, participants\u2019 eye movements were virtually unaffected by the configuration of the visual stimuli presented in the trial (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morvan and Maloney, 2012</a>). In contrast, we found that participants used both their prior knowledge of stimulus statistics as well as evidence accumulated about the current visual scene to guide their eye movements. We speculate that better performance in our case may be due to our more naturalistic task, which involves the extraction of abstract latent features, revealing more typical processing of the sensorimotor system."

First, our gaze-contingent display involved exposing small patches of the image at each fixation whereas in natural vision information is available from the full visual field, albeit with decreasing acuity away from the fovea. If participants\u2019 selection process was aware of and actively optimized for the changed field of vision in our task, the resulting eye movement patterns could be different from those in natural vision. Nevertheless, the basic summary statistics of (macro-)saccades in our task (average size and inter-saccadic intervals) were similar to those found in natural vision (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hayhoe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Land and Tatler, 2009</a>), and there was a lack of adaptation to the task over the course of several days of free-scan sessions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Importantly, in our task these involuntary processes are likely to be used for extracting information within each revealed patch, whereas high-level categorization required macro-saccades. This is because these involuntary processes cover an area with a standard deviation (SD) on the order of 0.22\u00b0 (over the course of each fixation; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rolfs, 2009</a>), which is similar to our Gaussian apertures (SD of 0.18\u00b0), whereas the smallest length scale of our stimuli (0.91\u00b0) is 4 times larger.

In addition, our task focuses on integrating low-level visual information into an abstract category thus complementing studies that examine the effect of target value (<a href=\"#bib31\">Navalpakkam et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Markowitz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schutz et al., 2012</a>) or more cognitive tasks that use eye movement (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nelson and Cottrell, 2007</a>) or button-pressing for information search (<a href=\"#bib3\">Castro et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gureckis and Markant, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Borji and Itti, 2013</a>). Some of these studies used a similar Bayesian formalism to obtain the active learning strategies specific to their tasks and showed that humans perform active learning when given the opportunity to consciously deliberate from which location in a scene they should gather information next. In contrast, our work shows that high-efficiency active sensing is a natural strategy for eye movements that humans adopt without overt deliberation, as evidenced by the inter-saccadic intervals matching naturalistic tasks and the fact that our participants reached near-asymptotic efficiency already in the first session of our task."

This is in contrast with studies that attempted to quantify the general informativeness of single locations in a scene (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gosselin and Schyns, 2001</a>), and showed that they are the target of fixations humans tend to choose in general (<a href=\"#bib34\">Peterson and Eckstein, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Toscani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chukoskie et al., 2013</a>), or visual search in which, by the nature of the task, the target location is fully informative by itself (<a href=\"#bib29\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>). As such, most previous studies have not addressed the important interplay between information gathering and fixation selection characteristic of naturalistic active sensing: that, in general, the most informative location is ever-changing, dependent on the history of fixations one has already performed."

In particular, it provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under active eye movements by carefully matching our observer model to participants\u2019 performance. As a result, for the first time, we were able to dissociate the contributions of the eye-movement selection process from those of perceptual, motor, and decision processes, identify predominant sources of apparent sub-optimality in active sensing, and quantify the efficiency of choosing each individual fixation throughout scanning a whole scene. Taken together, these features make our approach amenable to multiple tasks in different perceptual domains (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</a>), as well as high-level cognitive tasks such as estimating the age or socio-economic status of people in a scene (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yarbus, 1967</a>)."

A randomly generated image from one of the categories was then displayed but initially completely obscured by a black mask. Participants could freely scan the display, and wherever they fixated, the underlying image was revealed by unmasking a small aperture at the fixation location. This was achieved by revealing an isotropic Gaussian region with standard deviation 0.18\u00b0 at the fixation location, with the values of the Gaussian used to interpolate linearly between complete transparency (alpha=0) at the maximum of the Gaussian and black (alpha=1) where the value of the Gaussian is 0. A new fixation was detected, and hence a new revealing triggered, when the following three criteria were met: 1) a saccade had occurred since the last fixation as determined by eye speed greater than 59\u00b0\u2009s<math id=\"inf56\"><msup><mi/><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math>; 2) the displacement from the previous fixation was greater than 0.59\u00b0; and 3) the standard deviation of the eye position was less than\u00a00.28\u00b0 for the last 100 ms. These parameters were based on pilot experiments with the aim of making the revealings in the free-scan session feel natural so that each location viewed was revealed and spurious locations were not revealed. Participants were required to make 25 fixations before making their decision. After the 25 revealings, the category choices appeared (P vs. S) and participants had 60 s to choose a category with the revealed locations remaining on the display. Upon answering, participants were shown the full image with audio feedback. All participants achieved an average performance of 70% accuracy or higher."

This was critical as in the passive revealing conditions, although participants may detect and follow the revealings, because they are small and dispersed, they need to scan the scene to find and view them all. Therefore, the reason for allowing additional time after the final revealing was so as to make sure they had a chance to extract as much information as they liked from the revealed locations (locations and pixel values). In order to make the conditions directly comparable, we followed the same procedure in the active condition. Thus, allowing a rescanning period was the only way we could make a fair comparison across conditions using our gaze contingent design, which in turn allowed fine control over the information participants could obtain by eye movements."

Therefore, as we were analyzing the initial scanning, the final rescanning simply equalized the information that could be extracted from each revealing for all conditions but it was unlikely to influence the initial selection. Although, it is theoretically possible that participants adopted a different eye movement strategy knowing they could freely re-visit already revealed locations, the rescanning control (described below) suggests that this was not the case (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Saccades are known to be variable and biased, and to incorporate this variability and bias into our model we measured saccadic variability and bias in an independent experiment with 6 participants (including two from the main experiment) under similar conditions to those in the free-scan session of the main experiment. Although in the main experiment participants chose the location they wished to saccade to, to reliably measure saccadic variability and bias we needed to know the target of the saccade but not display it. Therefore we first trained participants on the locations of two saccadic targets and that on each trial the color of a stimulus shown at the fixation point indicated to which of these they needed to saccade. The two targets were at equal eccentricity from the fixation point, one to the right and one above it. On each training trial, participants first fixated a central fixation cross. Then two isotropic Gaussian patches (SD\u00a00.18\u00b0 as in the main experiment) appeared, one at the fixation location and one at one of the two target locations. The color of the fixation patch determined where the eccentric target was, either to the right (red) or above (blue), and participants were informed that the relation between the fixation color and the target direction was fixed throughout the experiment. To ensure that participants paid attention to the target, they were asked to report the color of the eccentric target which could either be red or blue. Note that this task by itself did not necessarily require them to saccade to the target, to avoid overtraining on particular saccades, but ensured that they developed a strong association between the color of the central fixation stimulus and the location of the target on that trial, such that in the next phase we could instruct them to saccade to a particular target without showing it. A training session of 40 trials was performed for each target eccentricity tested (1.39, 2.78, 5.56 and 8.34\u00b0 in this order) with each session followed by a test session of 100 trials with the same eccentricity."

As in the free-scan sessions, a patch was revealed wherever the participant fixated, and their task was to report the target\u2019s color. However, as this first eye movement was often inaccurate (see below) it did not necessarily reveal the target which needed to be reported. Thus, to motivate participants by making the task feasible, they were allowed to make four additional eye movements, leading to more revealings, before reporting the color of the target. (Although they were allowed 5 revealings, they were instructed to be as accurate as possible with their first eye movement.) The entire image was then shown as feedback."

We removed trials in which participants did not accurately maintain fixation (drift of &gt;0.56\u00b0) or where they clearly mis-directed their saccade (saccade was closer to the non-cued target). We calculated the bias and standard deviation (robust estimate from the median absolute deviation) both along (tangential) and orthogonal (SD only) to the direction of the target. We fit the bias and SD as a linear function of target distance for both the tangential and orthogonal components for each participant (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We averaged the model parameters across the participants and used these values to corrupt the desired saccade locations in the BAS simulations\u00a0(unless otherwise noted)."

Therefore, for each trial we first shifted all the revealing locations in that trial equally so that their mean (centre of mass) was located at the centre of the image, thereby removing the variability caused by which part of the image the participants explored in that trial, which was irrelevant to optimality. We then computed the mean density maps by assigning the revealing locations to centers of a 770<math id=\"inf113\"><mo>\u00d7</mo></math>770 grid of bins (the resolution of the images), normalizing the counts, and smoothing the distribution with an isotropic Gaussian filter (std. of 20 bins, ie. <math id=\"inf114\"><mrow><mi/><mo>\u223c</mo><msup><mn>0.73</mn><mo>\u2218</mo></msup></mrow></math>). For a balanced comparison, we computed densities as if each trial had 25 revealings and the three underlying patterns were chosen with equal probability. To achieve this we multiplied the count for the n<sup>th</sup> revealings by both the relative frequency of first revealings to n<sup>th</sup> revealings and by the inverse of the frequency of the image type. For each participant, we computed the mean density map across all trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> first column) and the mean-corrected density map for each underlying image type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> last three columns) by removing the mean from those averaged for each image type. The density maps for BAS were generated with simulations that used the same trials (image and number of revealings) that the participants performed. We repeated the simulation of each trial 10 times to obtain a reliable Monte Carlo estimate of the BAS revealing density maps marginalized over the unknown perceived pixel values."

This number of samples was chosen to be the maximum number that still allowed the image type and revealing number to be sampled with equal probability without replacement. To increase the sample size for all revealings we only examined revealings from 5 onwards.

Similarly, for across-type correlations, we computed the six correlations between the mean-corrected maps of different image types (across the two different halves of the split), and averaged these six correlations to obtain a single across-type correlation value. We repeated this procedure 1000 times, using a different random split of the data each time, to obtain the means, SD, and 95% confidence intervals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

However, there was an extended discussion among the reviewers about the extent to which the current results apply to natural vision. The reviewers agree that the authors need to qualify their conclusions to clearly state that while they were trying to emulate natural vision, their task was unnatural in several important ways (e.g. very small exposures, uniform statistics, small saccades not allowed, and reviewing for up to 60s after presentation in the passive conditions), all of which may have changed the participants' strategy from that used in natural vision. Natural vision works under entirely different constrains \u2013 larger exposures, natural scene statistics, all saccades allowed, and limited time. Under these constrains the selection of targets may (or may not) be completely different. These differences between the paradigm used in the study and natural vision should be carefully discussed, and relevant parts of the Abstract and Discussion should be modified accordingly."

The authors compare the fixation density maps for the three different stimulus categories and find that they are consistent and category-specific across participants, i.e. each stimulus category evokes a specific pattern of fixations. When revealing locations randomly controlled by the computer the categorization performance decreases indicating that active sensing does increase the information yield for the participants. Next, they construct an ideal observer model that computes the posterior probability of each category given the revealed pixel values, and fit the parameters prior bias, perception noise and decision noise to predict the subject's choice of category. Based on these parameters fitted to the subject's category choice the authors try to predict saccade choices using a Bayesian active sensor algorithm which chooses the saccade location which maximizes the expected information gain, taking into account saccade inaccuracies. They claim that the subject's saccades are predicted well by their Bayesian active sensor algorithm, as the predicted category-specific fixation density maps are significantly correlated with the actual density maps. As a better measure of the goodness of their model they compare the information (in the ideal observer sense) gained by the subject's saccades to the information gained by their simulated saccades, random saccades and saccades based on other strategies. They find that the information gained by the subject's saccades is higher than random saccades and saccades based on three heuristic strategies but lower than the information of the saccades simulated by the Bayesian active sensor, even if prior bias, perception noise and category decision noise are taken into account. They call the latter discrepancy a 30% inefficiency of saccade choice. To show that the saccade choices made by the subject are indeed not optimal in efficiency of making the category choice, they reveal the fixation locations computer-controlled based on the optimal locations predicted by the active Bayesian sensor model without biases and low noise. Thereby, the subject's categorization performance is increased. The efficiency of saccade choice does not vary over time, so there does not appear to be any learning."

At the end, the reader should understand the biological meaning of each strategy (that is, a biologically-plausible description of the strategy employed by their subjects in this task, and a strategy they would employ in a natural task), the rational of why one strategy is better than the other, and in what sense humans are sub-optimal."

Active sensing has been introduced, studied and discussed at various levels for various species and modalities for years, and intensively so for the last decade or two. Nevertheless, the paper sounds as if these concepts are only beginning to be addressed, and as if active vision is mostly covered by addressing saccades scanpath selections. This introduces a huge distortion of the concepts of active sensing and active vision. Active vision is much more than scanpath selections. Eye movements include saccades and drifts, and as far as we know today vision does not occur without the drift movements. Saccades include large and small (\"micro\") saccades, making a continuous spectrum of saccade amplitudes. In this study only large (&gt; 1 deg) saccades were allowed. Thus, this study ignores a substantial portion of visually-crucial eye movements. While this is ok as a reductionist method, it is not ok to ignore the reduced-away components in the discussion and interpretation of the results. Thus:"

This was critical as in the passive revealing conditions, although participants may detect and follow the revealings, because they are small and dispersed, the participants need to scan the scene to find and view them all. Therefore, the reason for allowing additional time after the final revealing was so as to make sure they had a chance to extract as much information as they like from the revealed locations (locations and pixel values). In order to make the conditions directly comparable, we followed the same procedure in the active condition. Thus, allowing a rescanning period was the only way we could make a fair comparison across conditions using our gaze contingent design, which in turn allowed us fine control over the information participants could obtain by eye movements."

During the active condition all the selection happens prior to the rescanning phase and participants do not know how many saccades they will be allowed so they still need to be efficient in revealing locations even if they can rescan them later. Therefore, as we are analyzing the initial selection, the final rescanning simply equalizes the information that can be extracted from each revealing for all conditions but it is unlikely to influence the initial selection. Although, it is theoretically possible that participants adopted a different eye movement strategy knowing they could freely re-visit already revealed locations, given the little improvement they showed across sessions in our task (Figure 7), this remains a highly unlikely possibility."

We expected that participants would use rescanning time so that information extracted from the revealings would have saturated by the time of choice. To examine whether rescanning time had an effect on performance, we fit each participant\u2019s choice accuracy as a logistic function (bounded between 0.5 and 1) of rescanning time. We allowed different shifts per condition (active, passive random, passive BAS) but the same slope parameter across conditions. This showed that for two participants there was a significant effect of rescanning time on performance (i.e. slope significantly different from zero) but with a decrement in performance for longer rescanning times. The probability of a correct decision for rescanning times at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the rescanning time distribution falls from 0.77 to 0.54 (p&lt;0.001) and from 0.77 to 0.66 (p &lt;0.03) for these two participants. We have included this information in the revision. Therefore, if anything, participants did not use longer rescanning times to improve performance but may have taken a little extra time when they were uncertain. In contrast, their performance correlated quite strongly with the number of revealings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This indicates that the main determinant of their performance was how well they chose the revealing locations in the first place, rather than how long they rescanned the location, as our original results already showed."

The results from this show that the revealing density maps are very similar to those from the original experiment (average within-type vs. across-type correlation across the two groups of participants: 0.63 vs. 0.30) and performance is also similar (although not surprisingly slightly worse). The proportion correct across all active revealing trials for the original participants was 0.65, 0.66 &amp; 0.69 (average 0.66) and for the new controls 0.64, 0.58 &amp; 0.66 (average 0.63).

Therefore, for each trial we first shifted all the revealing locations in that trial equally so that their mean (centre of mass) was located at the centre of the image, thereby removing the variability caused by which part of the image the participants explored in that trial, which is irrelevant to optimality (due to the translationally invariant nature of the statistics of our images, see above). This analysis leads to much cleaner and more compelling maps and we have redone all analyses (correlations of revealing densities) based on these new densities. We checked that all conclusions (including those reported in the response to reviewers below) remained the same (although quantitatively stronger) compared to the original absolute location method."

The first part is \u201cunexplained variance\u201d (equivalent to the second term on the right hand side of Eq. 1): even if we knew what the image type was, there is still uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the stimulus and perception noise. Unexplained variance <i>increases</i> with distance from revealings. Because the stimulus is spatially correlated, i.e. it is not white noise, knowing about the pixel value at a particular revealing location provides some information about nearby pixel values but not about distant pixel values. The second part is \u201cexplained variance\u201d (equivalent to our BAS score, Eq. 1) and it is due to uncertainty about image type and the fact that each type predicts different pixel values at the characteristic length scale of stimulus spatial correlations. At very short length scales, each image type is bound to predict the same pixel values as that at the revealing location (as they are constrained by this observation), and so the explained variance is diminishingly small, and beyond the stimulus correlation length scale the differences again become small as the average predictions are the same (zero) due to stochasticity. Thus, explained variance peaks around the stimulus correlation length scales (which in our case are small relative to the total image size) and fall off from there, resulting in a contribution that predominantly <i>decreases</i> with distance from revealings. Therefore, the total uncertainty determined as a combination of these two sources of uncertainty can peak at the borders or at intermediate distances, close to the autocorrelation length scale of the stimulus, depending on the balance of these two sources, which in turn depends on the revealed pixel values (and locations)"

Eye movements include saccades and drifts, and as far as we know today vision does not occur without the drift movements. Saccades include large and small (\"micro\") saccades, making a continuous spectrum of saccade amplitudes. In this study only large (&gt; 1 deg) saccades were allowed. Thus, this study ignores a substantial portion of visually-crucial eye movements. While this is ok as a reductionist method, it is not ok to ignore the reduced-away components in the discussion and interpretation of the results. Thus:</i>"

When we calculated the correlation in our original analysis, the number of samples increased with the number of revealing on the x-axis. This means that the increasing separation could have arisen from the increasing sample size. We have therefore modified the way we calculate the correlation and ensured that the number of samples used to construct the density maps remains the same as the number of revealing increases. The new results are in the updated <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. As one can see, the trend of the correlation curves is the same: the within- and across- type correlations increasingly separate as a function of revealing, with the within-type correlation increasing and the across-type correlation decreasing. In contrast, the shuffling analysis shows that the correlation curves remain constant as a function of revealing number. This is expected for the shuffling case because the density maps are now constructed with random subsamples of the same pool of data regardless of revealing number. The shuffled results are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> but we don\u2019t think they need to be included in the paper as they have to be flat by construction now that we have ensured that the sample size is independent of revealing number.

It would be very interesting to see how much of the performance reduction is caused by these biases. It should be possible to assess these biases directly from the existing data.</i> It is important to clarify that the suboptimalities the Reviewer asks us to identify are conceptually different from those that we factored out using the specific biases and noise included in the (non-ideal) BAS model. The ones we considered are suboptimalities that arise in the execution of a planned saccade (as in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), while the ones that the reviewer refers to could be suboptimalities of the planning itself. As we are interested in the degree of (sub)optimality of the planning component, we thought it would be misleading to factor out the biases the Reviewer is considering.

With the old analysis of the density maps that uses the absolute revealing locations (see point 4 in response to the editor), we see that the participants actually tend to fixate away from the center compared to BAS. Similarly, with the new analysis that uses relative locations, we see that the participants actually tend to have a more diffuse distribution of fixation compared to BAS (see mean revealing density maps in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The fact that the revealings chosen by BAS are more efficient and more concentrated at the center of the field of view (both in absolute and shifted position) suggests that this type of fixation bias will actually improve the performance rather than reduce it and therefore would not account for any sub-optimality."

In particular, it is not clear to us how we can measure bias directly from the existing data (as the reviewer suggests) separate from any active strategy as we do not know where subjects are aiming.
