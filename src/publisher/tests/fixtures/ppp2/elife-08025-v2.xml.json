The most abundant ganglion cell type in mice, the so-called W3 ganglion cell, selectively responds to movements of small objects. Where and how object motion sensitivity arises in the retina is incompletely understood. In this study, we use 2-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings to characterize responses of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)-expressing amacrine cells (ACs) to a broad set of visual stimuli. We find that these ACs are object motion sensitive and analyze the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation. Anatomical circuit reconstructions suggest that VGluT3-expressing ACs form glutamatergic synapses with W3 ganglion cells, and targeted recordings show that the tuning of W3 ganglion cells' excitatory input matches that of VGluT3-expressing ACs' responses. Synaptic excitation of W3 ganglion cells is diminished, and responses to object motion are suppressed in mice lacking VGluT3. Object motion, thus, is first detected by VGluT3-expressing ACs, which provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3 ganglion cells."

The most abundant ganglion cell type in mice, the so-called W3 ganglion cell, selectively responds to movements of small objects. Where and how object motion sensitivity arises in the retina is incompletely understood. In this study, we use 2-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings to characterize responses of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)-expressing amacrine cells (ACs) to a broad set of visual stimuli. We find that these ACs are object motion sensitive and analyze the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation. Anatomical circuit reconstructions suggest that VGluT3-expressing ACs form glutamatergic synapses with W3 ganglion cells, and targeted recordings show that the tuning of W3 ganglion cells' excitatory input matches that of VGluT3-expressing ACs' responses. Synaptic excitation of W3 ganglion cells is diminished, and responses to object motion are suppressed in mice lacking VGluT3. Object motion, thus, is first detected by VGluT3-expressing ACs, which provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3 ganglion cells."

The most abundant RGC type in the mouse retina (W3-RGC) was recently shown to respond selectively to movements of small\u2014in terms of size on the retina\u2014objects (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Detecting object motion is a challenging task as head, body, and eye movements frequently shift the retinal image (<a href=\"#bib30\">Martinez-Conde et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</a>). To distinguish movements of objects and the background, object motion sensitive (OMS) RGCs respond to differences in the timing of texture movements in their receptive field center and surround (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). W3-RGCs share key properties with OMS RGCs in rabbit and salamander, but, due to stronger surround suppression, do not respond at the border of larger objects (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). This feature is reminiscent of local-edge-detector RGCs described in several species (<a href=\"#bib27\">Levick, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Roska et al., 2006</a>). W3-RGCs, thus, appear to be in the intersection of OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs. Although postsynaptic inhibition and spike thresholds sharpen the tuning of W3-RGCs, similar to other OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs, key response properties appear to be inherited from their excitatory input (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Russell and Werblin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). This suggests that feature selectivity arises presynaptic to W3-RGCs. Where and how object motion is first detected remains to be determined."

ACs are the most diverse class of neurons in the retina, encompassing 30\u201350 cell types (<a href=\"#bib28\">MacNeil and Masland, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>) that serve task-specific functions in vision (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dacheux and Raviola, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Euler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Munch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen and Li, 2012</a>). Although most ACs release \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, a wide range of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators can be found in different cell types including one expressing the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3) (gene: <i>Slc17a8</i>, protein: VGluT3, AC: VG3) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fyk-Kolodziej et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haverkamp and Wassle, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>). VG3-ACs are conserved from rodents to primates. Recent studies found that VG3-ACs respond to light increments (ON) and decrements (OFF) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>), show strong surround suppression, and following optogenetic or electrical stimulation can release glutamate (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>).

We find that VG3-ACs, like W3-RGCs, combine properties of OMS and local-edge-detector neurons and selectively detect movements of small objects. Using biolistics, we show that many excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs are apposed by boutons of VG3-ACs, and in whole-cell recordings from W3-RGCs, find that properties of their excitatory input match VG3-AC responses. Finally, we show amplitude and object motion preference of synaptic excitation and spike responses of W3-RGCs are reduced in VGluT3 knockout mice (<i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seal et al., 2008</a>).

After tamoxifen injection, a subset of VG3-ACs expresses tdTomato in <i>VG3-CreERT2 Ai9</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neurites of VG3-ACs stratify broadly in the center of the inner plexiform layer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>), occupy medium-sized lateral territories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, 7662 \u00b1 211 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, n = 39), and as a population, cover the retina approximately seven times (coverage: 6.88). To characterize light responses, we obtained <i>VG3-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>) in which all VG3-ACs express Cre (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), crossed them to <i>Ai9</i>, and targeted fluorescent somata in the inner nuclear layer (INL) for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Consistent with previous results, we find that VG3-ACs respond transiently to light increments and decrements, depolarizing to small and hyperpolarizing to large stimuli (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this switch in response polarity is caused by a combination of pre- and post-synaptic surround inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Excitatory and voltage-response receptive fields are well fit by Difference-of-Gaussians models (<a href=\"#bib9\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMahon et al., 2004</a>), whereas a single Gaussian is sufficient to describe the monotonic rise of inhibition with stimulus size. For all components, OFF responses exceed ON responses, and for voltage responses and excitatory inputs, ON receptive fields are larger in diameter than their OFF counterparts. We characterized the temporal tuning of VG3-AC responses and underlying synaptic inputs in more detail using white noise stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Inner nuclear and GCLs are bordering the top and bottom, respectively, of this image. (<b>B</b>) Intensity profiles (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 10 retinas) of these labels show that VG3-ACs stratify in sublamina 2 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) of the IPLs, the boundaries of which are marked by Calretinin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wassle, 2004</a>). Note the potential strategic importance of this laminar position. We find that OMS responses of VG3-ACs depend on convergent input from transient rectified ON and OFF bipolar cells. <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> contain terminals of OFF and ON bipolar cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wassle et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, bipolar cells with transient responses stratify near the center of the IPL (i.e., <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), whereas axons of bipolar cells with sustained responses stratify closer to its borders (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baden et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>). Finally, a recent study identified gradients in the linearity of glutamate release across the IPL with more rectified bipolar cells stratifying towards the middle (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>). Stratification in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, thus, positions VG3-ACs ideally to recruit input from transient rectified ON and OFF bipolar cells, as well as to form synapses with dendrites of W3-RGCs. The strategic importance of this laminar position is further corroborated by the observation that in all species examined, VG3-ACs and LED RGCs stratify near the center of the IPL (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Famiglietti, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>)."

Third order neurons that receive convergent rectified input from bipolar cells can detect motion and other changes in patterns with structure on the scale of bipolar cells' receptive fields even when the average luminance across their own receptive fields does not change (i.e., nonlinear spatial integration) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Victor and Shapley, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Demb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). To evaluate input rectification of VG3-ACs, we presented sinusoidally modulated split-field stimuli in which the receptive field center was divided evenly or in a biased manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We then compared the power of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses at once (F1) and twice (F2) the frequency of modulation (2 Hz, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Excitatory input to biased split-field stimuli is modulated primarily at the stimulus frequency and recapitulates the OFF-preference of VG3-ACs. The F2-dominant responses to even split-field stimulation indicate that this excitatory input is provided by rectified bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grimes et al., 2014</a>). To test whether inhibition, like excitation, is driven by rectified receptive field subunits and to measure their spatial extent, we sinusoidally modulated square-wave gratings with different bar widths in an annular region overlaying the receptive field surround (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) show frequency-doubled (F2) responses characteristic of rectified input (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>). F2 power increases in a step-like fashion between bar widths of 25 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm, suggesting that bipolar cells are likely the cellular substrate for nonlinear subunits (<a href=\"#bib48\">Victor and Shapley, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Demb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). Thus, VG3-ACs receive rectified excitatory input from transient ON and OFF bipolar cells, and inhibition from ACs, which themselves appear to be driven by rectified input from possibly the same types of bipolar cells."

Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this response pattern is caused by preferential excitation during center-only motion and strong inhibition elicited whenever motion includes the surround (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E,D</a>). Since the average luminance in center and surround regions does not change in this stimulus, the observed responses provide further evidence that both are composed of rectified subunits, allowing VG3-ACs to detect when an object moves at a different time than the background irrespective of the precise spatial patterns involved, a defining feature of OMS neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baccus et al., 2008</a>)."

Narrow dark bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs elicited transient depolarizations as leading and trailing edges cross the receptive field center. Robust edge responses were observed over a wide range of motion speeds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>) and were indistinguishable for leading and trailing edges in spite of the opposite polarity of the associated temporal contrast. Responses of VG3-ACs are not directionally selective (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to voltage recordings, transient EPSCs and IPSCs were observed during edge transits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). EPSCs and IPSCs were larger at leading than trailing edges and showed a preference for the faster speeds tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). However, the ratio of excitation and inhibition remained relatively constant across these conditions, which likely accounts for the greater constancy of edge responses observed in voltage recordings. Local edge detectors are typically stimulated robustly by narrow contrast edges, but not by expansive ones (<a href=\"#bib27\">Levick, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>). We, therefore, recorded responses of VG3-ACs to bars of varying heights moving across their receptive field at a constant speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Edge responses were strongly suppressed for bar heights above 200 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L,M</a>). Trailing edge responses to the smallest bars were lower than leading edge responses, likely a consequence of the asymmetric size of VG3-ACs' ON and OFF receptive field centers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Similar to voltage responses, excitatory synaptic inputs showed edge response suppression for larger stimuli, whereas inhibition rose and plateaued with increasing bar height (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N,O</a>), corroborating that surround inhibition acts both pre- and post-synaptic in VG3-ACs. VG3-ACs, thus, show key response features of OMS and local-edge-detector neurons, and through the synaptic mechanisms outlined above, selectively detect movements of small objects."

Surround suppression of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs was found to rely on spiking ACs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). To test whether surround suppression of VG3-ACs is similarly mediated by spiking ACs and to assess its importance to feature detection, we tested the effect of the sodium channel blocker TTX on VG3-ACs' responses in differential motion and edge detection stimulus paradigms. In the presence of TTX, VG3-ACs depolarized to global motion as well as differential center motion, and hyperpolarizations observed during surround stimulation were abolished (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Edge responses elicited by narrow bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs at a variety of speeds were not changed by TTX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), but the suppression observed for larger bars was blocked (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Surround inhibition, thus, is critical for the feature detection of VG3-ACs and appears to be mediated by spiking ACs. The use of spikes to signal surround motion likely improves temporal coincidence of inhibitory input with bipolar cell depolarization and excitatory input to VG3-ACs during coherent motion, leading to more effective cancellation of center signals by the surround."

Recent optogenetic experiments and paired recordings suggest that VG3-ACs can release glutamate and activate postsynaptic receptors on several RGC types, including W3-RGCs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Whether and how VG3-ACs contribute to visual processing in these RGCs remains unknown. Given our results on object-motion detection, we focus here on VG3-ACs' connections with and influence on W3-RGCs. To obtain anatomical evidence for or against excitatory synapses between VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs, we biolistically labeled W3-RGCs with cytosolic cerulean fluorescent protein and PSD95 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (PSD95-YFP) in <i>VG3-Cre Ai9</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). PSD95-YFP selectively localizes to excitatory synapses on RGC dendrites (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morgan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kerschensteiner et al., 2009</a>). More than half of the PSD95-YFP puncta on W3-RGCs were apposed by VG3-ACs boutons, whereas few appositions with VG3-ACs were observed when PSD95-YFP puncta were randomly repositioned along the dendrites in Monte Carlo simulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). We next characterized spike responses and synaptic inputs of W3-RGCs with the same differential motion and edge detection stimuli used for VG3-ACs, revealing matching tuning properties of excitatory input to W3-RGCs with responses of VG3-ACs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

W3-RGCs were either recorded under conventional infrared illumination and identified by characteristic responses in cell-attached recordings or targeted under 2-photon guidance in <i>Isl2</i>-<i>GFP</i> transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Triplett et al., 2014</a>). In both cases, correct targeting was confirmed by intracellular dye filling and reconstruction of dendritic arborizations at the end of the recordings. (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) Summary data of spike rate (<b>B</b>, <i>black</i>), excitatory (<b>C</b>, <i>red</i>), and inhibitory (<b>D</b>, <i>blue</i>) response amplitudes to <i>global</i>, differential center (<i>diff</i><sub><i>Ce</i></sub>), and differential surround (<i>diff</i><sub><i>Su</i></sub>) motion segments. Dots show data from individual cells and circles (error bars) indicate mean (\u00b1 SEM) of the respective population. W3-RGCs remain mostly silent during global and differential surround motion stimulation, but show robust spike responses to grating movements restricted to their receptive field center (n = 13, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22127</sup> for <i>diff</i><sub><i>Ce</i></sub> vs <i>global</i> and vs <i>diff</i><sub><i>Su</i></sub>). Differential motion sensitivity of WG3-RGCs appears to be inherited from their excitatory input, which during center-only motion exceeds that observed during global motion nearly fivefold, and which is suppressed from tonic levels during isolated surround stimulation (n = 8, p &lt; 0.003 for <i>diff</i><sub><i>Ce</i></sub> vs <i>global</i> and vs <i>diff</i><sub><i>Su</i></sub>). In addition, W3-RGCs receive stronger direct inhibition when grating movements include the surround (n = 7, p &lt; 0.001 for <i>diff</i><sub><i>Ce</i></sub> vs <i>global</i> and vs <i>diff</i><sub><i>Su</i></sub>) (<b>E</b>\u2013<b>J</b>) Representative spike rate (<b>E</b>, <i>black</i>), EPSC (<b>G</b>, <i>red</i>), and IPSC (<b>I</b>, <i>blue</i>) traces and summary data of spike (<b>F</b>, <i>black</i>), excitatory (<b>H</b>, <i>red</i>), and inhibitory (<b>J</b>, <i>blue</i>) response amplitudes to dark bars (height: 200 \u03bcm) moving at different speeds indicated by matching color saturation of example traces and summary data. Circles (error bars) represent the mean (\u00b1 SEM) of these data sets (spikes n = 32, excitation n = 8, inhibition n = 5). (<b>K</b>\u2013<b>P</b>) Representative spike rate (<b>K</b>, <i>black</i>), EPSC (<b>N</b>, <i>red</i>), and IPSC (<b>O</b>, <i>blue</i>) responses elicited by bars of different heights moving at 400 \u03bcm/s and summary data of spike rate (<b>L</b>, <i>black</i>), excitatory (<b>N</b>, <i>red</i>), and inhibitory (<b>P</b>, <i>blue</i>) response amplitudes. Bar heights are encoded by matching color saturation of responses traces and summary data. Circles (error bars) represent the mean (\u00b1 SEM) of these data sets. Responses of W3-RGCs are progressively suppressed when bar heights increase above 100 \u03bcm (n = 14, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22124</sup> for 200 \u03bcm vs 600 \u03bcm bar heights). The spatial tuning of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs is similar to that observed in spike responses (n = 6, p &lt; 0.02 for 200 \u03bcm vs 600 \u03bcm bar heights), whereas inhibition rises monotonically and saturates with increasing bar heights (n = 6, p &gt; 0.4 for 200 \u03bcm vs 600 \u03bcm bar heights)."

Removal of VGluT3, which in the retina is only expressed by VG3-ACs, affected neither gross morphological development of the retina (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) nor dendritic patterns of W3-RGCs (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). EPSCs elicited by differential center motion were reduced by approximately 50% in W3-RGCs of <i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> compared to wild-type (<i>WT</i>) mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). By contrast, excitation during global motion and tonic excitation revealed by differential surround stimulation were unchanged. A similar pattern was observed in the spike responses of W3-RGCs, which were selectively decreased for differential center but not global motion stimuli (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). Similarly, EPSCs and spike responses evoked by edges of narrow moving bars (height: 100 \u03bcm) were suppressed across a wide range of speeds in <i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013L</a> and <i>data not shown</i>), whereas excitation and spike responses elicited by broader moving bars remained intact in <i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013L</a>). In agreement with anatomical results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), VG3-ACs, thus, appear to provide approximately half of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs. Importantly, feature selectivity of this VG3-input is more sharply tuned than the excitatory input remaining in <i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice\u2014likely provided by ON and OFF bipolar cells\u2014and is required for normal spike responses of W3-RGCs."

Multi-tiered inhibition combined with delayed excitation, and successive threshold nonlinearities likely contribute to sharpening. Surround inhibition acts at three levels: bipolar axon terminals, VG3-ACs, and W3-RGCs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Key features\u2014transient ON and OFF input driven by rectified subunits\u2014are similar at all three stages, arguing that inhibition is provided by a single AC type or a shared set of AC types, which remain to be identified. The added level of inhibition onto VG3-ACs compared to conventional pathways through bipolar cells likely contributes to the more complete surround suppression in the OMS circuit. Moreover, channeling of excitation through VG3-ACs introduces a delay not shared by the inhibitory input, which could improve cancellation of center signals by the surround, for example, during global image motion. The sequential arrangement of three thresholding nonlinearities\u2014glutamate release from bipolar cells, glutamate release from VG3-ACs, and spike generation in W3-RGCs\u2014likely further contributes to the increasing selectivity for narrow vs broad edges and differential center vs global texture motion at successive stages of the OMS circuit. Finally, our results support the notion that the diversity of AC types and circuit motifs in which they participate are integral to the diversity of features encoded in the signals the retinal sends to the brain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Masland, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</a>)."

Both <i>VG3-CreERT2</i> and the noninducible <i>VG3-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grimes et al., 2011</a>) mice were crossed to a fluorescent reporter strain expressing tdTomato in a Cre-dependent manner (<i>Ai9</i>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>) to enable anatomical reconstructions and targeted patch-clamp recordings from VG3-ACs. Contributions of VGluT3-mediated neurotransmission to visual processing in the retina were evaluated by comparing knockout mice (<i>VGluT3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seal et al., 2008</a>) and <i>WT</i> littermates. <i>Isl2-GFP</i> transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Triplett et al., 2014</a>) were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC), to which they were donated by Dr Nathaniel Heintz and used for targeted patch-clamp recordings of W3-RGCs."

Circles of different size were presented in different pseudorandom sequences for each cell, and the first stimulus in the sequence repeated at its end to confirm stability of the recording. Temporal response functions and filter properties were analyzed using Gaussian white noise stimulation in which the intensity of a circular region over the receptive field center (voltage, excitation) or an annular region covering its surround (inhibition) was chosen at random from a normal distribution (RMS contrast: 40%) and updated at 30 Hz for 10 min. The properties of spatial integration were tested using sine-wave modulated (2 Hz) contrast-reversing square-wave gratings (varying spatial frequency) masked to preferentially stimulate the center (excitation) and surround (inhibition) regions of a receptive field. To test the sensitivity of VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs to differential or coherent luminance-neutral motion stimuli in their receptive field center and surround, the respective parts of square-wave gratings (bar width: 50\u201375 \u03bcm) were moved separately or in unison. A gray annulus was included in the spatial layout of the stimulus to reliably separate movement in the center and surround. Edge detection properties were tested by moving dark and light bars of different heights (50\u2013600 \u03bcm) and constant width (800 \u03bcm) across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs at a variety of speeds (100\u2013800 \u03bcm/s).

Response amplitudes to a variety of stimuli\u2014circles of varying size and contrast, bars of different size and contrast moving at a variety of speeds and differential or global motion of gratings\u2014were measured as baseline-subtracted averages (spike rate, conductance, or voltage) during 100\u2013200 ms time windows. To estimate spatial receptive field parameters, we fit Difference-of-Gaussians (voltage, excitation) or single Gaussian (inhibition) models to area response data (<a href=\"#bib9\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMahon et al., 2004</a>). Receptive field sizes were measured as the diameter of the respective Gaussians at 1 SD. To analyze of VG3-ACs, we recovered separate ON and OFF filters from responses to Gaussian white noise stimulation. First, overlapping stimulus segments were weighted by their ensuing baseline-subtracted response (voltage or conductance) to compute the response-weighted stimulus ensemble, analogous to the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble frequently used in the characterization of RGC responses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>). We then identified the dimension of highest variance in the response-weighted stimulus ensemble by principle components analysis and separated response-weighted stimulus segments in two groups based on their projection onto this first principle component (positive = ON, negative = OFF). ON and OFF segments were averaged to determine ON and OFF filters, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The amplitudes of these linear filters were scaled such that their sum equaled the sum of the global response-weighted stimulus average. Similar procedures have previously been used to analyze the contributions of ON and OFF pathways to RGC spike trains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fairhall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Greschner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</a>). To summarize temporal frequency tuning and sensitivity across several cells, Fourier amplitudes of ON and OFF filters were calculated. To characterize spatial integration, Fourier amplitudes of responses at once (F1, 2 Hz) and twice (F2, 4 Hz) the frequencies of sine wave modulation of contrast-reversing square-wave gratings over the receptive field center (excitation) or surround (inhibition) were analyzed. Edge detection tuning was measured from response amplitudes as leading and trailing edges of dark or bright bars of different heights moving at a variety of speeds crossed the receptive field center. Similarly, response amplitudes during selective (center or surround) or global (center and surround) luminance-neutral motion stimuli were compared to reveal differential motion sensitivity."

W3-RGCs) expressed CFP and PSD95-YFP following biolistic transfection. Using local thresholding W3-RGC dendrites, PSD95 puncta and VG3-AC neurites were masked separately in Amira (FEI Company). Excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs formed by VG3-ACs were defined as PSD95 clusters with a center of mass within 0.5 \u03bcm from a VG3-AC neurite. We confirmed that varying this distance from 0.25 to 1 \u03bcm did not qualitatively change the results. Given the size of synaptic puncta, this range implies overlap or direct apposition of signals from PSD95-YFP and tdTomato in VG3 neurites. To compare the input fraction (i.e., fraction of PSD95 puncta apposed by a VG3 neurite) to chance levels, positions of PSD95 puncta were randomized within the synaptic layer in Monte Carlo simulations. Territories occupied by neurites of VG3-ACs and dendrites of W3-RGCs were measured by the area of the smallest convex polygon to encompass the respective arbors in a z-axis projection of image stacks acquired in flat-mounted retinas. To analyze soma distributions of VG3-ACs, we used a previously described algorithm to automatically identify cell positions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Soto et al., 2012</a>) and calculated the density recovery profiles of these positions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rodieck, 1991</a>)."
