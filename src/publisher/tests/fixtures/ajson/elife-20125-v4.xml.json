To identify mutations contributing to common non-syndromic midline (sagittal and metopic) craniosynostosis, we performed exome sequencing of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Thirteen probands (7%) had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in <i>SMAD6</i>, an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (p&lt;10<sup>\u221220</sup>). <i>SMAD6</i> mutations nonetheless showed striking incomplete penetrance (&lt;60%). Genotypes of a common variant near <i>BMP2</i> that is strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis explained nearly all the phenotypic variation in these kindreds, with highly significant evidence of genetic interaction between these loci via both association and analysis of linkage. This epistatic interaction of rare and common variants defines the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis and has implications for the genetic basis of other diseases."

To identify mutations contributing to common non-syndromic midline (sagittal and metopic) craniosynostosis, we performed exome sequencing of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Thirteen probands (7%) had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in <i>SMAD6</i>, an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (p&lt;10<sup>\u221220</sup>). <i>SMAD6</i> mutations nonetheless showed striking incomplete penetrance (&lt;60%). Genotypes of a common variant near <i>BMP2</i> that is strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis explained nearly all the phenotypic variation in these kindreds, with highly significant evidence of genetic interaction between these loci via both association and analysis of linkage. This epistatic interaction of rare and common variants defines the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis and has implications for the genetic basis of other diseases."

This search revealed that rare mutations that disable one copy of a gene called <i>SMAD6</i> in combination with a common DNA variant near another gene called <i>BMP2</i> account for about 7% of infants with midline forms of craniosynostosis. These genes are both known to regulate how bones form, which explains how the mutation of these genes could lead to craniosynostosis."

The metopic suture normally closes between 6 and 12 months, while the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid sutures typically fuse in adulthood (<a href=\"#bib29\">Persing et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weinzweig et al., 2003</a>). Premature fusion of any of these sutures can result in brain compression and suture-specific craniofacial dysmorphism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Studies of syndromic forms of craniosynostosis, each with prevalence of ~1/60,000 to 1/1,000,000 live births and collectively accounting for 15\u201320% of all cases, have implicated mutations in more than 50 genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Twigg and Wilkie, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Flaherty et al., 2016</a>). For example, mutations that increase MAPK/ERK signaling (e.g. <i>FGFR1-3</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Twigg and Wilkie, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Flaherty et al., 2016</a>), <i>ERF</i> [<a href=\"#bib39\">Twigg et al., 2013</a>]) cause rare syndromic coronal or multisuture craniosynostosis, while mutations that perturb SMAD signaling (e.g. <i>TGFBR1/2</i> [<a href=\"#bib21\">Loeys et al., 2005</a>], <i>SKI</i> [<a href=\"#bib7\">Doyle et al., 2012</a>], <i>RUNX2</i> [<a href=\"#bib24\">Mefford et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Javed et al., 2008</a>]) cause rare syndromes involving the midline (sagittal and metopic) sutures. While the detailed pathophysiology of premature suture fusion has not been elucidated, aberrant signaling in cranial neural crest cells during craniofacial development has been suggested as a common mechanism (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mishina and Snider, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Komatsu et al., 2013</a>)."

We considered that the often sporadic occurrence of non-syndromic craniosynostosis might frequently be attributable to de novo mutation or incomplete penetrance of rare transmitted variants."

All probands had undergone reconstructive surgery for either isolated sagittal (n\u00a0=\u00a0113), metopic (n\u00a0=\u00a070) or combined sagittal and metopic (n\u00a0=\u00a08) craniosynostosis. Seventeen kindreds had 1 to 3 additional affected family members, including 7 parents, 12 siblings, 3 aunts/uncles and 4 more distant relatives of probands. DNA was prepared from buccal swab samples. Exome sequencing was performed as described in Materials and methods; summary data are shown in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. Variants were called using the GATK pipeline (see Materials and methods) and de novo mutations in parent-offspring trios were called using TrioDeNovo (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wei et al., 2015</a>). The impact of identified missense variants on protein function was inferred using MetaSVM (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dong et al., 2015</a>). All de novo calls were verified by in silico visualization of aligned reads (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and all calls contributing to significant results for individual genes were verified by direct Sanger sequencing."

Comparison of the observed distribution of mutation types to the expected from the Poisson distribution demonstrated significant enrichment of protein-altering mutations, predominantly accounted for by an excess of damaging missense mutations (MetaSVM D-mis; 28 observed D-mis compared to 14.5 expected, p=1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup>, 1.93-fold enrichment), with a corresponding paucity of silent mutations (21 compared to 40.4 expected, p=3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20134</sup>).

All three were heterozygous and occurred in families in which the proband was the sole affected member. Two de novo mutations occurred in probands and one occurred in an unaffected mother of a proband (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). All three de novo mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons containing the putative mutation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>TTN</i>, which encodes the largest human protein, was the only other gene with more than one protein altering de novo mutation, and both of these were predicted by MetaSVM to encode tolerated variants (p.I3580M, p.T19373S). From the prior probability of de novo mutation of each base in <i>SMAD6</i> and the impact on the encoded protein (<a href=\"#bib32\">Samocha et al., 2014</a>), the probability of seeing at least two de novo LOFs and one missense mutation by chance in a cohort of this size was 3.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20139</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Similarly, observing two or more de novo LOF mutations in any gene in this cohort was not expected by chance (p=8.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup>, see Materials and methods). Lastly, <i>SMAD6</i> is not unusually mutable, as we found no de novo <i>SMAD6</i> mutations in 900 control trios comprising healthy siblings of individuals with autism (<a href=\"#bib15\">Iossifov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">O'Roak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sanders et al., 2012</a>).

Among 191 probands, we found 1135 rare LOF and 3156 rare damaging (LOF + D-mis) alleles. The probability of the observed number of rare variants in each gene occurring by chance was calculated from the binomial distribution after adjusting for the length of each gene; Q-Q plots comparing the observed and expected P-value distributions are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. The observed distribution conforms closely to expected with the exception of <i>SMAD6</i>. The expected number of rare LOF alleles in <i>SMAD6</i> in probands was 0.05, and the observed number was 8 (p=1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201315</sup>, 156-fold enrichment). Similarly, there were 13 rare damaging variants in <i>SMAD6</i> compared to 0.14 expected (p=1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201321</sup>, 91.4-fold enrichment). All of these <i>SMAD6</i> variants were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All were heterozygous and different from one another (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>); 11 were absent among &gt;10<sup>5</sup> alleles in the ExAC database, while two were previously seen, each once in ExAC (p.E407* and p.R465C, ExAC allele frequencies 9.0\u00a0\u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> and 9.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> respectively). The results for <i>SMAD6</i> remain highly significant after excluding de novo mutations and only analyzing transmitted variants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), demonstrating a\u00a0significant contribution of both de novo and transmitted variants (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The fact that eight of the 13 rare heterozygous damaging variants in <i>SMAD6</i> seen in our cohort are frameshift (n = 5) or premature termination (n = 3) mutations, which are distributed throughout the encoded protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), strongly supports haploinsufficiency as the mechanism of the genetic contribution of <i>SMAD6</i> to craniosynostosis."

Activation of BMP receptors leads to phosphorylation of receptor SMADs, which can complex with SMAD4, translocate to the nucleus and partner with RUNX2 to induce transcription of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Javed et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hata et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). This process is inhibited by SMAD6 binding to phosphorylated receptor SMADs, forming an inactive complex. SMAD6 also inhibits BMP signaling by complexing with the ubiquitin ligase SMURF1, which ubiquitylates BMP receptors, receptor SMADs and RUNX2, leading to their proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murakami et al., 2003</a>). This pathway plays a well-established role in the\u00a0development of the cranial vault and closure of cranial sutures. In mice, constitutive activity of BMPR1A in cranial neural crest results in SMAD-dependent development of metopic craniosynostosis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Komatsu et al., 2013</a>), and genetic deficiency for the SMAD inhibitor <i>SMURF1</i> causes midline craniosynostosis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shimazu et al., 2016</a>). Similarly, duplication of <i>RUNX2</i> causes syndromic metopic craniosynostosis in humans (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mefford et al., 2010</a>). Lastly, <i>SMAD6</i> knockout mice are born with domed skulls and show anomalous bone deposition in the metopic suture; they also show an augmented and prolonged response to BMP2 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Estrada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Retting, 2008</a>). These findings are consistent with haploinsufficiency as the mechanism of <i>SMAD6</i> mutations in craniosynostosis, with loss of the inhibitory effect of SMAD6 promoting increased BMP signaling and premature closure of sutures."

In particular, zero of 10 parental <i>SMAD6</i> mutation carriers had a diagnosis of, or showed evidence of craniosynostosis.

BMP2 is a ligand for BMP receptors upstream of SMAD signaling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Salazar et al., 2016</a>) and is an inducer of osteogenesis. We posited that risk alleles at this locus might increase the penetrance of <i>SMAD6</i> mutations by increasing BMP2 levels and further increasing SMAD signaling.

Fourteen individuals had both a <i>SMAD6</i> mutation and the rs1884302 risk allele; 100% of these had craniosynostosis. In contrast, 16 subjects had a <i>SMAD6</i> mutation but no rs1884302 risk allele; only 3 of these individuals (19%) had craniosynostosis. Lastly, 0 of 18 members of these kindreds who had only the rs1884302 risk allele had craniosynostosis. The relationship of these two genotypes to craniosynostosis in these kindreds was highly significant (p=1.4\u00a0\u00d7 10<sup>\u201310</sup> by the Freeman-Halton extension of Fisher\u2019s exact test; <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>)."

There is extremely strong evidence implicating each locus independently, along with highly significant evidence from both analysis of association and linkage that the risk of craniosynostosis is markedly increased in individuals carrying risk alleles at both loci compared to those with only a single risk allele at either locus. Rare damaging variants in <i>SMAD6</i> alone impart very large effects on disease risk with low penetrance, with inheritance at <i>BMP2</i> explaining nearly all of the variation in occurrence of craniosynostosis seen among <i>SMAD6</i> mutation carriers. The results support a threshold effect model, with quantitative increases in SMAD signaling resulting from reduced inhibition of SMAD signaling by SMAD6, owing to haploinsufficiency (strongly supported by a plethora of LOF variants distributed across <i>SMAD6</i>), along with a putative increase in SMAD signaling owing to increased BMP2 expression via the risk SNP rs1884302 leading to accelerated closure of midline sutures. Consistent with this model, as articulated previously, substantial prior evidence in mouse and human has implicated BMP signaling via SMADs in closure of the midline sutures, and <i>SMAD6</i> in inhibiting this pathway. Moreover, consistent with the common variant near <i>BMP2</i> modifying BMP2 expression, duplication of a nearby limb-specific enhancer increased BMP2 expression, leading to a Mendelian limb defect (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dathe et al., 2009</a>). While the genetic data provide unequivocal support for the role of these two loci in midline craniosynostosis, and for haploinsufficiency as the mechanism of <i>SMAD6</i> contribution, further studies will be necessary to delineate the precise mechanism by which the risk genotypes cause disease."

Also like autism and congenital heart disease, few individual genes were implicated after sequencing modest numbers of trios, implying that de novo mutation in a large number of genes are likely to contribute to sagittal and metopic craniosynostosis. This observation strongly supports sequencing substantially larger numbers of non-syndromic patients, an approach that has proved highly productive for discovery of genes and pathways underlying autism and CHD."

The data are of very high quality, the manuscript clearly written, and the conclusions convincingly supported by the data. The investigators performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Seven percent of probands had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in SMAD6; an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (P &lt;10-20). Interestingly, SMAD6 mutations showed striking incomplete penetrance for the craniosynostosis trait (&lt;60%). Genotypes of a common variant near BMP2, previously shown to be strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis, explained nearly all of the phenotypic variance in these kindred. Thus, these findings clearly documented digenic inheritance via epistatic interactions of rare and common variants as a defining feature of the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis. This work has very important implications for the genetic basis of other disease traits and reveals a potential mechanism for common variant genetic effects to markedly influence the manifestation of disease."

It is thus possible that heterozygous loss of function mutations in <i>SMAD7</i> have a more extreme, potentially early lethal, phenotype than <i>SMAD6</i> mutations, accounting for why we have not seen these mutations in our cohort.
