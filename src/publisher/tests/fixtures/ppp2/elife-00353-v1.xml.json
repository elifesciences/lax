But I was truly taken aback that this intelligent and thoughtful young woman felt she could say this to my face because it assumed and presumed so much. I comfort myself with the thought that if I were to see her today, she would have the grace to be embarrassed to have used those words. I hope that by now she has understood that every individual finds satisfaction in different ways, and that what is a \u2018good life\u2019 for one person may not suit another. For example, some of my best friends have splendid gardens that give them great joy. I love looking at other people's gardens, but it would never cross my mind to leave the city\u2014with its harbour and caf\u00e9s\u2014to live in a house with a garden."

He said that he watched, with great sadness, friends who were aspiring poets, painters and musicians who worked jobs they hated to pay the bills, and then tried to paint and write after they were tired by days filled with tedium. In contrast, I get paid to do a job that I enjoy; I choose to work long hours because I spend most of those hours doing things I value. Family is also central to a good life. Families can be those we were born into, those we create, and those we may find at work. Science often creates strong bonds between labmates and colleagues, and friendships that endure for lifetimes."

There were times during grad school\u2014and later as a postdoc and an assistant professor\u2014when I thought about quitting. But I didn't, because at the end of day, I liked thinking about science, working in the lab, reading about science, and being around smart people. And I liked my independence and autonomy. So I kept going, often with no more than a vague trust that when one did things for the right reasons, the future would take care of itself."
