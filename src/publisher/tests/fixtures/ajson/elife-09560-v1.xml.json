This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> is unique, but most similar to early <i>Homo</i> species including <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i> or <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <i>H. naledi</i> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa."

This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> is unique, but most similar to early <i>Homo</i> species including <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i> or <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <i>H. naledi</i> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa."

Furthermore, while the skull had several unique features, it had a small braincase that was most similar in size to other early hominin species that lived between four million and two million years ago. <i>Homo naledi</i>'s ribcage, shoulders and pelvis also more closely resembled those of earlier hominin species than those of modern humans."

The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be attributed to no previously-known hominin species. Here we describe this new species, <i>Homo naledi</i>.

Aside from the fragmentary rodent teeth, all dental crowns (n = 179) are hominin, recovered both from surface collection and excavation. Likewise, aside from the few bird elements, all morphologically informative bone specimens are clearly hominin. In all cases where elements are repeated in the sample, they are morphologically homogeneous, with variation consistent with body size and sex differences within a single population.

Surface-collected hominin material from the present top of Unit 3, which includes material derived from both Unit 2 and Unit 3, represents a minority of the assemblage, and is morphologically indistinguishable from material excavated from in situ within Unit 3. In addition to general morphological homogeneity including cranial shape, distinctive morphological configurations of all the recovered first metacarpals, femora, molars, lower premolars and lower canines, are identical in both surface-collected and excavated specimens (see Figure 14 later in the text). These include traits not found in any other hominin species yet described. These considerations strongly indicate that this material represents a single species, and not a commingled assemblage."

Frontal bossing is evident, as is a marked degree of parietal bossing. There is no indication of metopic keeling, though there is slight parasagittal keeling between bregma and lambda, and some prelambdoidal flattening. The cranial vault bones are generally thin, becoming somewhat thicker in the occipital region. The supraorbital torus is well developed, though weakly arched, and is bounded posteriorly by a well-developed supratoral sulcus. The lateral corners of the supraorbital torus are rounded and relatively thin. The temporal lines are widely spaced, and there is no indication of a sagittal crest or temporal/nuchal cresting. The temporal crest is positioned on the posterior aspect of the lateral supraorbital torus, rather than on the superior aspect as in australopiths. At the posteroinferior extent of the temporal lines, they curve anteroinferiorly presenting a well-developed angular torus. The crania have a pentagonal outline in posterior view, with the greatest vault breadth located in the supramastoid region. The nuchal region exhibits sexually dimorphic development of nuchal muscle markings and the external occipital protuberance, and there is a clear indication of a tuberculum linearum in addition to the external occipital protuberance. In superior view the vault tapers from posterior to anterior, though post-orbital constriction is slight. The squamosal suture is low and gently curved, and parietal striae are well defined. The lateral margins of the orbits face laterally. A small zygomaticofacial foramen is typically present near the center of the zygomatic bone. The root of the zygomatic process of the maxilla is anteriorly positioned, at the level of the P<sup>3</sup> or the P<sup>4</sup>. There is no indication of a zygomatic prominence, and the zygomatic arches do not flare laterally to any extent. The root of the zygomatic process of the temporal is angled downwards approximately 30\u00b0 relative to FH. The root of the zygomatic process of the temporal begins to laterally expand above the level of the mandibular fossa, rather than above the level of the EAM as in australopiths. The mandibular fossa is somewhat large, and moderately deep. The articular eminence of the mandibular fossa is saddle-shaped, and oriented posteroinferiorly. Almost the entire mandibular fossa is positioned medial to the temporal squama. The entoglenoid process is elongated and faces primarily laterally. The postglenoid process is small and closely appressed to the tympanic, forming part of the posterior wall of the fossa. The petrotympanic is distinctly coronally oriented. The vaginal process is small but distinct. The crista petrosa is weakly developed and not notably sharpened. There is a strong Eustachian process. The external auditory meatus is small, oval-shaped, and obliquely oriented, and a distinct suprameatal spine is present. The mastoid region is slightly laterally inflated. The mastoid process is triangular in cross-section, with a rounded apex and a mastoid crest. The digastric groove is deep and narrow, alongside a marked juxtamastoid eminence. The canine juga are weakly developed and there is no indication that anterior pillars would have been present. A shallow, ill-defined canine fossa is indicated. The nasoalveolar clivus is flat and square-shaped. The parabolic-shaped palate is broad and anteriorly shallow, becoming deeper posteriorly."

A slight supreme lateral torus (of Dart) weakly delineates the extramolar sulcus from the lateral corpus.

The marginal torus is moderately developed, and defines a moderate intertoral sulcus. The posterior and anterior marginal tubercles are indicated only as slight roughenings of bone. The gracile mandibular symphysis is vertically oriented. A well-developed mental protuberance and weak lateral tubercles are delineated by a slight mandibular incisure, thereby presenting a weak mentum osseum. The post-incisive planum is steeply inclined and not-shelf-like. There is no superior transverse torus, while a weak, basally oriented inferior transverse torus is present. The anterior and posterior subalveolar fossae are continuous and deep, overhung by a well-developed alveolar prominence. The extramolar sulcus is moderately wide. The root of the ramus of the mandible originates high on the corpus at the level of the M<sub>2</sub>. Strong ectoangular tuberosities are indicated. A large mandibular foramen is present, with a diffusely defined mylohyoid groove."

The shared derived features that connect <i>H. naledi</i> with other members of <i>Homo</i> occupy most regions of the <i>H. naledi</i> skeleton and represent distinct functional systems, including locomotion, manipulation, and mastication. Locomotor traits shared with <i>Homo</i> include the absolutely long lower limb, with well-marked linea aspera, strong <i>M. gluteus maximus</i> insertions, gracile fibula and generally humanlike ankle and foot. These aspects of the lower limb suggest enhanced locomotor performance for a striding gait. The <i>H. naledi</i> hand shares aspects of <i>Homo</i> morphology in the wrist, thumb and palm, pointing to enhanced object manipulation ability relative to australopiths, including <i>Au. sediba</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kivell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kivell et al., 2015</a>). <i>H. naledi</i> lacks the powerful mastication that typifies <i>Australopithecus</i> and <i>Paranthropus</i>, with generally small teeth across the dentition, gracile mandibular corpus and symphysis, laterally-positioned temporal lines, slight postorbital constriction and non-flaring zygomatic arches. The upper limb, shoulder and ribcage have a more primitive morphological pattern, but do not preclude affiliating <i>H. naledi</i> with <i>Homo</i>, particularly considering that postcranial remains of <i>H. habilis</i> appear to reflect an australopith-like body plan (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johanson et al., 1986</a>).

Further, the discovery of <i>Au. sediba</i> showed that a mosaic of <i>Homo</i>-like hand, pelvis and aspects of craniodental morphology can occur within a species with primitive body size, limb proportions, lower limb and foot morphology, thorax shape, vertebral morphology, and brain size (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kivell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Churchill et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">DeSilva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmid et al., 2013</a>). <i>H. naledi</i> presents yet a different combination of traits. This species combines a humanlike body size and stature with an australopith-sized brain; features of the shoulder and hand apparently well-suited for climbing with humanlike hand and wrist adaptations for manipulation; australopith-like hip mechanics with humanlike terrestrial adaptations of the foot and lower limb; small dentition with primitive dental proportions. In light of this evidence from complete skeletal samples, we must abandon the expectation that any small fragment of the anatomy can provide singular insight about the evolutionary relationships of fossil hominins."

The cranial and dental affinities identified between <i>Au. sediba</i> and <i>Homo</i> include many features shared by <i>H. naledi.</i> But <i>H. naledi</i> and <i>Au. sediba</i> share different postcranial features with other species of <i>Homo</i>. Resolving the phylogenetic placement of <i>H. naledi</i> will require both postcranial and craniodental evidence to be integrated together. Such integration poses a challenge because of the poor representation of several key species both within and outside of <i>Homo</i>, most notably <i>H. habilis</i>, for which postcranial evidence is slight, and <i>H. rudolfensis</i> for which no associated postcranial remains are known. We propose the testable hypothesis that the common ancestor of <i>H. naledi</i>, <i>H. erectus</i>, and <i>H. sapiens</i> shared humanlike manipulatory capabilities and terrestrial bipedality, with hands and feet like <i>H. naledi</i>, an australopith-like pelvis and the <i>H. erectus-</i>like aspects of cranial morphology that are found in <i>H. naledi</i>. Enlarged brain size was evidently not a necessary prerequisite for the generally human-like aspects of manipulatory, locomotor, and masticatory morphology of <i>H. naledi</i>."

Considering that <i>H. naledi</i> is a morphologically primitive species within our genus, an age may help elucidate the ecological circumstances within which <i>Homo</i> arose and diversified. If the fossils prove to be substantially older than 2 million years, <i>H. naledi</i> would be the earliest example of our genus that is more than a single isolated fragment. The sample would illustrate a model for the relation of adaptive features of the cranium, dentition and postcranium during a critical time interval that is underrepresented by fossil evidence of comparable completeness. A date younger than 1 million years ago would demonstrate the coexistence of multiple <i>Homo</i> morphs in Africa, including this small-brained form, into the later periods of human evolution. The persistence of such a species with clear adaptations for manipulation and grip, alongside MP humans or perhaps even alongside modern humans, would challenge many assumptions about the development of the archaeological record in Africa."

The entire Dinaledi collection is remarkably homogeneous. There is very little size variation among adult elements within the collection. Eight body mass estimates from the femur (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) have a standard deviation of only 4.3 kilograms, for a body mass coefficient of variation (CV) of only 9%. The CV of body mass within most human populations is substantially higher than this, with an average near 15% (<a href=\"#bib45\">McKellar and Hendry, 2009</a>). Likewise, the size variation of cranial and dental elements is minimal. With 11 mandibular first molars, the CV of buccolingual breadth is only 3.2% and for 13 maxillary first molars the CV of buccolingual breadth is only 2.0% (buccolingual breadth is used because it is not subject to variance from interproximal wear). Not only size, but also anatomical shape and form are homogeneous within the sample. Almost every aspect of the morphology of the dentition, including the distinctive form of the lower premolars, the distal accessory cuspule of the mandibular canines, and the expression of nonmetric features that normally vary in human populations, is uniform in every specimen from the collection. The distinctive aspects of cranial morphology are repeated in every specimen, and even the aspects that normally vary among individuals of different body size or between sexes exhibit only slight variation among the Dinaledi remains. One of the most unique aspects of <i>H. naledi</i> is the morphology of the first metacarpal; the derived aspects of this anatomy are present in every one of seven first metacarpal specimens in the collection (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). Unlike any other fossil hominin site in Africa, the Dinaledi Chamber seems to preserve a large number of individuals from a single population, one with variation equal to or less than that found within local populations of modern humans."

All of these show a marked robusticity of the distal half of the bone, a very narrow, \u2018waisted\u2019 appearance to the proximal shaft and proximal articular surface, prominent crests for attachment of <i>M. opponens pollicis</i> and <i>M. first dorsal interosseous</i>, and a prominent ridge running down the palmar aspect of the bone. The heads of these metacarpals are dorsopalmarly flat and strongly asymmetric, with an enlarged palmar-radial protuberance. These distinctive features are present among all the first metacarpals in the Dinaledi collection, and are absent from any other hominin sample.

South African material is of special interest in this comparison because of the geographic proximity, and because of the difficulty of clearly identifying <i>Homo</i> specimens within the large fossil sample from Swartkrans. In particular, the following specimens from Swartkrans are considered to represent <i>H. erectus</i>: SK 15, SK 18a, SK 27, SK 43, SK 45, SK 68, SK 847, SK 878, SK 2635, SKW 3114, SKX 257/258, SKX 267/2671, SKX 268, SKX 269, SKX 334, SKX 339, SKX 610, SKX 1756, SKX 2354, SKX 2355, SKX 2356, and SKX 21204. It has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grine et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">1996</a>) that SK 847 and Stw 53 might represent the same taxon, and that this taxon is a currently undiagnosed species of <i>Homo</i> in South Africa.

Because there is no clear indication that more than one species of <i>Homo</i> is represented in the Swartkrans sample, we consider all this material to belong to <i>H. erectus</i>. We considered \u2018<i>Homo ergaster</i>\u2019 (and also \u2018<i>Homo aff. erectus</i>\u2019 from <a href=\"#bib70\">Wood, 1991</a>) to be synonyms of <i>H. erectus</i> for this study; Turkana Basin specimens that are attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> thus include KNM-ER 730, KNM-ER 820, KNM-ER 992, KNM-ER 1808, KNM-ER 3733, KNM-ER 3883, KNM-ER 42700, KNM-WT 15000.

These include KNM-ER 1472, KNM-ER 1481, KNM-ER 3228, KNM-ER 737, and others. We may add other fossils from other sites lacking association with craniodental material, such as the partial BOU-VP 12/1 skeleton and even the Gona pelvis. These specimens attributable to <i>Homo</i> but not necessarily to a particular species did inform our understanding of variability within the genus, but for the most part these specimens do not inform our differential diagnosis of <i>H. naledi</i> relative to particular species. For example, the key element of femoral morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> in contrast to other species is the presence of two well-defined mediolaterally running pillars in the femoral neck; the isolated specimens of early <i>Homo</i> do not contradict this apparent autapomorphy. Likewise, no isolated specimens inform us about the humanlike aspects of foot morphology in <i>H. naledi</i>. In these cases, the lack of associations for this evidence actually is less important than the lack of specimens that replicate the distinctive features of the <i>H. naledi</i> morphology."

In GeoMagic Studio 14.0, the endocranial surface of the composite was carefully selected from the ectocranial surface and copied as a new object. In order to obtain a volume calculation the model has to be a closed surface, meaning that all of the holes in the surface model had to be filled. Small holes in the model were filled using the \u2018Fill by Curvature\u2019 function. Larger holes were filled in by sections. For example, the cranial base was filled in using a number of transverse sections, so that in the absence of the cranial base the contour of the various cranial fossae and the petrous portions of the temporal could be preserved as best as possible. When appropriate (e.g., around angular portions of the petrous bone), small sections were filled using a flat hole filling function. The new surfaces created by the hole-filling mechanism were carefully monitored and repeated until an acceptable model that appeared to best approximate the missing portions was obtained. The result is a closed model approximation of the endocranium, of which a volume can be calculated by GeoMagic Studio (<a href=\"#fig19\">Figure 19</a>, <a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20</a>). The volume of the smaller composite cranium (DH3 and DH4) indicates a cranial capacity of approximately 465 cm<sup>3</sup>."

We use only African populations in this comparison because the ratio of tibia length to femur length, and thereby the proportion of stature constituted by tibia length, varies between human populations both today and prehistorically. Although we do not know this proportion for <i>H. naledi</i>, we adopt the null hypothesis that they likely had tibia/femur proportions similar to other African population samples."
