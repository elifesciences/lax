Take a few hundred adolescents in school, each with unique genetic and cultural influences, and you would expect to see huge diversity in behaviour. Instead, we generally find that teenagers fall into one of a small number of groups that have their own distinct identities and patterns of behaviour (or misbehaviour). Similarly, the genetic make-up of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the parasite that causes most fatal malaria cases, suggests that many different strains of malaria should exist in a host population: in reality, however, only a small number of strains, each with distinctive clinical and epidemiological features, are observed. Peer pressure is the driving force for a finite set of teenager behaviours (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown et al., 1986</a>), and the immune response of humans appears to be the driving force for the same effect in many pathogens."

The virulence of <i>P. falciparum</i> is believed to arise from its ability to evade the human immune system by changing the antigens that are released. Many important pathogens, including <i>P. falciparum</i>, constantly exchange genetic material: however, the number of strains of malaria (and other diseases) is much lower than expected, given the level of genetic exchange that happens. This has led to \u2018strain theory\u2019\u2014the idea that populations of parasites are restricted to specific subtypes (that is, different strains) as a result of their interactions with human immunity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gupta et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1996</a>). Now, writing in <i>eLife</i>, Yael Artzy-Randrup and co-workers at the University of Michigan, New York University and Princeton University extend strain theory and conclude that immune selection markedly influences populations of <i>P. falciparum</i>, restricting their diversity to a finite number of antigenic strains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Artzy-Randrup et al., 2012</a>)."

Each parasite expresses a single <i>var</i> gene at a time, while the rest remain transcriptionally silent. However, as the hosts develop antibodies against the single antigen that is being produced, small sub-populations of <i>P. falciparum</i> begin to produce other types of antigens so as to re-establish the infection. Artzy-Randrup and co-workers developed an \u2018agent-based model\u2019 to describe interactions between parasites and humans through simple mathematical rules that quantify genetic and epidemiological processes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bauer et al., 2009</a>)."

The strains do not, in general, have common <i>var</i> alleles, but partially overlapping <i>var</i> alleles can arise when the transmission intensity is high, as it is in many parts of Africa. High transmission intensities also lead to immunity being established in humans at earlier ages than happens in areas with lower transmission intensities, such as parts of Asia: the proportion of people who become immune is also higher in areas with high transmission intensities. The changes in the parasite population appear to be mostly a product of the traits of immune response of humans, while \u2018neutral\u2019 factors, such as genetic recombination from random mating, appear to have much less influence."

Despite this diversity, only a relatively small number of strains of malaria become established in any population: moreover, these strains tend to have little or no genetic overlap with each other. (<b>A</b>) This illustration (created by Artzy-Randrup et al. and motivated by real data) shows how 40 <i>var</i> genes (circles) can lead to 8 different strains of <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria (each composed of a subset of 6 genes). Five of these strains are unique as they do not genetically overlap with any of the other strains; two strains (shown in red and light blue) share all of their genes with other strains, and one strain (shown in purple) shares four of its genes with other strains. (<b>B</b>) The number of hosts immune to two strains of malaria versus age: strain 1 (orange) is genetically unique, so immunity to this strain is gained only through exposure to it; strain 2 (red) shares genes with other strains of malaria, so immunity to this strain can be acquired through exposure to it and also through exposure to two other strains of malaria. Immunity to strain 1 is higher than for strain 2 as human hosts are exposed to strain 1 at a higher level and at younger ages than strain 2. The grey bars show the host age distribution."

Then, in work that was just as influential as the work that won him the Nobel Prize, Ross developed mathematical models to describe the spread of malaria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ross, 1916</a>), which eventually paved the way for the spraying-based strategies that have been widely used in an effort to stop the spread of the disease (see <a href=\"#bib8\">McKenzie et al., 2008</a> for an historical review)."

The suggestion by Artzy-Randrup et al. that lower intensity transmission is linked with loss of immunity might be consistent with recent findings from India which suggest that malaria kills substantial numbers of rural adults who lack access to curative therapies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dhingra et al., 2010</a>)."
