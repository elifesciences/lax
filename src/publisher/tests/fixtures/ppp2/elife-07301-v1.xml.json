The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment\u2019 by Vermeulen and colleagues, published in <i>Nature Cell Biology</i> in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2F, 6D, and 7E. In these experiments, Vermeulen and colleagues utilize a reporter for Wnt activity and show that colon cancer cells with high levels of Wnt activity also express cancer stem cell markers (Figure 2F; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, treatment either with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts or with hepatocyte growth factor restored clonogenic potential in low Wnt activity colon cancer cells in vitro (Figure 6D; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>) and in vivo (Figure 7E; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment\u2019 by Vermeulen and colleagues, published in <i>Nature Cell Biology</i> in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2F, 6D, and 7E. In these experiments, Vermeulen and colleagues utilize a reporter for Wnt activity and show that colon cancer cells with high levels of Wnt activity also express cancer stem cell markers (Figure 2F; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, treatment either with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts or with hepatocyte growth factor restored clonogenic potential in low Wnt activity colon cancer cells in vitro (Figure 6D; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>) and in vivo (Figure 7E; <a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

Wnt signaling proteins mediate a wide variety of biological processes during development, including maintenance of stem cell populations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Malanchi and Huelsken, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Clevers et al., 2014</a>), and aberrant Wnt activation is linked to several diseases, including cancer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>). Vermeulen and colleagues showed that high Wnt activity correlated with markers of colon cancer stem cells and enhanced clonogenic potential of cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). They also showed that stromal myofibroblasts secreted factors such as HGF that enhanced Wnt activity and clonogenicity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). Further, treatment of more differentiated cells with myofibroblast conditioned medium (MFCM) enhanced Wnt activity in these cells and enhanced clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo, illustrating that colon cancer cell stemness can be modified by the microenvironment."

In Figure 2F, colon cancer stem cells were isolated from human colon cancer specimens and transduced with the TOP-GFP reporter. Wnt activity was then assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in populations derived from a single cell, and flow cytometry was concurrently used to assess the levels of the cancer stem cell markers CD133, CD24/CD29 or CD44/CD166 in these cells. Vermeulen and colleagues found that cells with high Wnt activity levels correlated with expression of cancer stem cell markers (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). Several other reports have used the TOP-GFP system or a similar reporter system to demonstrate that Wnt activity was enhanced in a population of cells expressing cancer stem cell markers. Correlation of cancer stem cells markers with high Wnt activity was found in primary and metastatic mouse mammary tumors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Malanchi et al., 2012</a>), spheroid cultures of colon cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Colak et al., 2014</a>), human and mouse colonic adenomas (<a href=\"#bib15\">Prasetyanti et al., 2013</a>), and primary colon cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kemper et al., 2012</a>). All of these studies also found that cells with high Wnt activity maintained clonogenicity, while cells with low Wnt activity had markedly reduced clonogenic potential. In contrast, one report did find that while high Wnt reporter activity did correlate with expression of cancer stem cell markers, the tumorigenic capacity of cells was not dependent upon Wnt activity in four of the five cell lines tested, including three cell lines derived from primary colon cancers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Horst et al., 2012</a>). The experiment presented in Figure 2F will be replicated in Protocol 2."

Clonogenic potential was measured using a limiting dilution assay in which cells were plated at a range of densities and the number of colonies that grow over time was counted. This experiment also examined the ability of the small molecular c-Met inhibitor, PHA-665752, to block MFCM or HGF-mediated clonogenicity. Vermeulen and colleagues showed that treatment of TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells with HGF or MFCM increased clonogenicity of these poorly clonogenic cells, and that clonogenicity could be reversed by c-Met inhibition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, MET has been reported to be enriched in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and promote their self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib12\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">De Bacco et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Joo et al., 2012</a>). Met inhibition could also reduce the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of GSCs, with activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway shown to be a key mediator of the HGF/Met signaling pathway in these cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Joo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). This experiment is replicated in Protocol 3. This result was expanded upon in Figure 7E to assess the effect of MFCM on TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells in vivo, where Vermeulen and colleagues found that TOP-GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells coinjected with MFCM, or an admixture of the factors these cells secrete, had enhanced tumorigenicity compared to TOP-GFP<sup>Low</sup> cells injected alone (<a href=\"#bib20\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). To assess the affect of MFCM on tumorigenicity, limiting dilutions of the different cell populations, in the presence or absence of MFCM, were injected subcutaneously into nude mice and tumor formation was measured over time. Likewise, HGF, along with other cytokines secreted from tumor-associated cells, was demonstrated to increase the tumorigenic activity and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Todaro et al., 2014</a>). This experiment is replicated in Protocol 4."

To perform all these studies with just one culture introduces a risk into the reproducibility study. I would therefore suggest using multiple primary cultures from different patients.

This will require extensive MTAs but may facilitate the studies tremendously. I will be happy to re-invest time in checking whether this is an option. In any case, the authors should consider to use a control for clonogenic studies using AC133 staining, which has been reported by many groups to identify CSCs in spheroids, but also does not uniformaly do so (i.e. HCT116 does not work).

This is the same test that will be used in the analysis of the replication results. The test can also be seen on the website of authors of the analysis (<a href=\"http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html\">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html</a>). This approach uses the asymptotic Chi-square approximation to the log-ratio, which is applicable in these contexts as described in their paper (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hu and Smyth, 2009</a>). We have updated the manuscript to make this clearer."
