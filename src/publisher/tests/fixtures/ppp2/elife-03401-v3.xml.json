Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology."

Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology."

This advantage allows them to spread through populations even if they reduce the fitness of individual organisms. Many researchers have suggested that these elements might serve as the basis for \u2018gene drives\u2019 capable of spreading engineered traits through wild populations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Craig et al., 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Wood et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Sinkins and Gould, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burt and Trivers, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alphey, 2014</a>). Austin Burt was the first to propose gene drives based on site-specific \u2018homing\u2019 endonuclease genes over a decade ago (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burt, 2003</a>). These genes bias inheritance by cutting the homologous chromosome, inducing the cell to copy them when it repairs the break. Several efforts have focused on the possibility of using gene drives targeting mosquitoes to block malaria transmission (<a href=\"#bib92\">Scott et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Windbichler et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib111\">2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib113\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Li et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Galizi et al., 2014</a>). However, development has been hindered by the difficulty of engineering homing endonucleases to cut new target sequences (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Thyme et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Takeuchi et al., 2014</a>). Attempts to build gene drives with more easily retargeted zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs suffered from instability due to the repetitive nature of the genes encoding them (<a href=\"#bib94\">Simoni et al., 2014</a>)."

Protospacers must be flanked by an appropriate protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), which is NGG for the most commonly used Cas9 protein (<a href=\"#bib61\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). If the spacer and protospacer are identical or have only a few mismatches at the 5\u2032 end of the spacer, Cas9 will cut both strands of DNA, creating a blunt-ended double-strand break. If supplied with a repair template containing the desired changes and homology to the sequences on either side of the break, the cell may use homologous recombination to repair the break by incorporating the repair template into the chromosome. Otherwise, the break will be repaired by non-homologous end-joining, resulting in gene disruption. Cas9 cutting is efficient enough to alter both chromosomes at the same time and/or to edit multiple genes at once (<a href=\"#bib69\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wang et al., 2013a</a>).

While the cas9 gene itself has no repeats, recombination between guide RNA cassettes or guide RNA promoters, most commonly the U6 promoter, is a possibility. (<b>B</b>) Using multiple guide RNAs with differing sequences that are known to retain function could reduce homology and thereby prevent instability. The length of the hairpin created by fusing the bacterial tracrRNA and crRNA can be varied by more than a dozen bases with equivalent activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Esvelt et al., 2013</a>), while tracrRNA equivalents from closely related bacteria can be substituted (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fonfara et al., 2013</a>).

The ideal standard gene drive confers an effective fitness benefit of 100%, as it is transmitted to twice as many progeny with no fitness cost. The fitness of suppression drives is more complicated due to species-specific density and resource-dependence and mating dynamics and must be considered on a case-by-case basis. The most challenging problem at the molecular scale concerns the highly variable rates of homologous recombination (HR) relative to non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in different species, cell types, and developmental stages. Cas9 cutting should ideally occur during a stage featuring efficient HR and minimal NHEJ to maximize fitness. Within the germline, homologous recombination rates are normally highest in the oocyte because NHEJ is nearly absent in that cell type. As development progresses, the incidence of NHEJ rises sharply even if the HR machinery remains active. For this reason, we anticipate that maternally transmitted drives that both cut and are copied into the paternal chromosome in the zygote will be among the most efficient. Paternally transmitted drives cannot cut the maternal chromosome until they are expressed, which occurs at different times in different species. Those species that initiate transcription comparatively early, such as mice, are likely to be more amenable to gene drives than those that begin late, such as Drosophila. However, this does not necessarily imply that HR occurs at low efficiency in Drosophila embryos; injecting Cas9 and guide RNA-encoding plasmids along with a template to be copied yielded correct insertions in 13/16 embryos (<a href=\"#bib49\">Gratz et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, injecting Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting two genes along with templates for repair into mouse embryos yielded 7/10 pups with the first insertion and 8/10 with the second insertion, with six of those having both; all other mice utilized NHEJ. We suspect that while drive copying rates will be difficult to predict in advance in a given species, any drive constructed with a housekeeping, viral, or strong germline promoter is likely to function reasonably well due to the combination of highly efficient maternal copying and moderate paternal copying in the zygote and early embryo. Germline copying can also occur later in development for standard drives. The difference between achiasmate species with low HR rates during meiosis, at least in males, and chiasmate species is likely to be crucial. The difference is clearly demonstrated by comparing the Anopheles drive, which exhibited 97% HR and a fitness benefit over 50% (25% given its restriction to males) (<a href=\"#bib113\">Windbichler et al., 2011</a>), to the equivalent Drosophila drive, which exhibited 71% HR and an effective fitness benefit of 32% (54% homing\u201322% NHEJ; a 16% benefit given its restriction to males) only after extensive optimization (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chan et al., 2013b</a>). The latter was improved from an initial construct demonstrating only 35% HR (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2011</a>), which is insufficient to generate a fitness benefit if targeting an essential gene and will generate more resistant alleles than copies of the drive if not. Limiting expression to the late germline may be very effective, but early germline or especially oocytic expression may be superior depending on the species. Finally, it may be possible to repress genes required for the competing non-homologous end-joining pathway using Cas9 in order to boost the effective homologous recombination rate in a particular germline stage (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Genes responsible for homologous recombination might be activated in a similar manner. The main question is whether the resulting changes in protein abundance will occur quickly enough to influence drive copying."

Whenever a cut is repaired using the NHEJ pathway, the result is typically a drive-resistant allele with insertions or deletions in the target sequence that prevent it from being cut by the endonuclease. Natural sequence polymorphisms in the population could also prevent cutting. These alleles will typically increase in abundance and eventually eliminate the drive because most drives \u2013 like most transgenes \u2013 are likely to slightly reduce the fitness of the organism. A second path to gene drive resistance would involve the target organism evolving a method of specifically inhibiting the drive endonuclease."

Because mutations in target sites are evolutionarily favored only when they survive confrontation with the gene drive, using many target sites can render it statistically improbable for any one allele to survive long enough to accumulate mutations at all of the sites so long as cutting rates are high (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burt, 2003</a>). However, very large populations \u2013 such as those of some insects \u2013 might require unfeasibly large numbers of guide RNAs to prevent resistance. In these cases it may be necessary to release several successive gene drives, each targeting multiple sites, to overcome resistant alleles as they emerge. From an evolutionary perspective, the ability to preclude resistance by targeting multiple sites is the single greatest advantage of RNA-guided gene drives."

Whenever the drive is copied, the cut gene is replaced with a recoded version flanked by the other components of the drive. Recent work has demonstrated that most genes can be substantially recoded with little effect on organism fitness (<a href=\"#bib66\">Lajoie et al., 2013</a>); the 3\u2032 untranslated region might be replaced with an equivalent sequence from a related gene.

For example, all of the methods of increasing Cas9 specificity described above were developed for RNA-guided genome editing in the past 2 years. Future methods of increasing the rate of HR relative to NHEJ would be useful for both technologies.

Once transgenic organisms bearing the gene drive are constructed in the laboratory, they must be released into the wild to mate with wild-type individuals in order to begin the process of spreading the drive through the wild population. The total time required to spread to all members depends on the number of drive-carrying individuals that are released, the generation time of the organism, the efficiency of homing, the impact of the drive on individual fitness, and the dynamics of mating and gene flow in the population, but in general it will take several dozen generations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Huang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Deredec et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Marshall, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Yahara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Deredec et al., 2011</a>).

While gene drives can spread traits through populations even if they are costly to each individual organism, harmful traits will eventually be outcompeted by more fit alleles after the drive has gone to fixation. Highly deleterious traits may be eliminated even more quickly, with non-functional versions appearing in large numbers even before the drive and its cargo can spread to all members of the population. Even when the trait is perfectly linked to the drive mechanism, the selection pressure favoring the continued function of Cas9 and the guide RNAs will relax once the drive reaches fixation. Maintaining deleterious traits within a population indefinitely is likely to require scheduled releases of new RNA-guided gene drives to periodically overwrite the broken versions in the environment."

For some drives, a single individual escaping to a non-target population could cause widespread population suppression or even extinction, while others would require multiple sequential escapees of particular drive types. Some drives will be quickly eliminated by natural selection if not continually re-released, others would require a reversal drive to restore the wild-type sequence but should not have any phenotypic effects, and the most aggressive would require a suitable immunizing drive to be released within a certain timeframe in order to prevent a population crash.

Because each drive would spread from a small number of initially released individuals scattered over a wide area, this strategy may be capable of large-scale population suppression, but its effectiveness and resolution will depend on the average distance between released A and B individuals. Further suppressing the residual A and B populations could be accomplished by releasing only members of the opposite drive type.

Dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas, and Lyme disease are also spread by insects. These afflictions could potentially be controlled or even eradicated by altering vector species to block transmission. Several laboratories have identified candidate gene disruptions or transgenes that interfere with the transmission of malaria (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ito et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Dong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Isaacs et al., 2012</a>) and other well-studied diseases (<a href=\"#bib38\">Franz et al., 2006</a>). Depending on their effectiveness, these alterations may or may not allow the disease to be eradicated before the pathogen evolves resistance. Alternatively, the relevant vector species might be suppressed or eliminated using RNA-guided gene drives, then potentially reintroduced from sheltered laboratory or island populations once disease eradication is complete. In the case of malaria, gene drive strategies may represent particularly effective solutions to the emerging problem of mosquito vectors with an evolved preference to bite and rest outdoors, traits that render them resistant to current control strategies based on indoor insecticide spraying and bednets."

For example, sensitizing drives could potentially reverse the mutations allowing the western corn rootworm to resist Bt toxins (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gassmann et al., 2014</a>) or horseweed and pigweed to resist the herbicide glyphosate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Gaines et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ge, 2010</a>), which is currently essential to more sustainable no-till agriculture. Because these three organisms undergo one generation per year, comparatively large numbers of drive-bearing individuals must be released to quickly exert an effect, but fewer than are already released to control pests using the sterile-insect technique (<a href=\"#bib48\">Gould and Schliekelman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Dyck et al., 2005</a>).

The economics of invasive species control are also compelling: the top ten invasives in the United States cause an estimated $42 billion in damages every year (<a href=\"#bib85\">Pimentel et al., 2005</a>). Black and brown rats alone cause $19 billion in damages and may be responsible for more extinctions than any other nonhuman species."

Another approach might utilize a sensitizing drive to render all populations newly vulnerable to a specific compound, which could then be used as a pesticide for the local control of invasive populations. All of these possibilities will require modeling and experimentation to establish safety and feasibility before use."

For example, most gene drive studies involving tropical malarial mosquitoes have been conducted in temperate regions in which the mosquitoes cannot survive or find mates. <i>Molecular containment</i> ensures that the basic requirements for drive are not met when mated with wild-type organisms. True drives must cut the homologous wild-type sequence and copy both the gene encoding Cas9 and the guide RNAs. Experiments that cut transgenic sequences absent from wild populations and copy either the gene encoding Cas9 or the guide RNAs - but not both - should be quite safe. Ecological or molecular containment should allow basic research into gene drive effectiveness and optimization to be pursued with negligible risk. <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> categorizes these and many other possible experiments according to estimated risk."

For example, releasing a laboratory-tested \u2018neutral\u2019 drive that is intended to cause no changes in organism phenotype beyond spreading its cas9 gene, guide RNAs, and recoded essential gene through the population is listed as a moderate risk because it will certainly edit a wild population, but in a way that is comparatively unlikely to affect its interactions with the ecosystem. Contained field trials of drives that do cause phenotypic changes are listed as moderate-high risk due to the very real possibility of a containment breach and subsequent unintentional population engineering; a standard drive with few or no expected phenotypic effects would represent a moderate risk, while a suppression drive would represent a high risk."

We have also included boxes that explicitly address whether gene drives could be used to alter populations of humans, crops, or domesticated animals.
