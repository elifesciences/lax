                    "text": "Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) is a heritable human sleep phenotype characterized by very early sleep and wake times. We identified a missense mutation in the human Cryptochrome 2 (<i>CRY2</i>) gene that co-segregates with FASP in one family. The mutation leads to replacement of an alanine residue at position 260 with a threonine (A260T). In mice, the <i>CRY2</i> mutation causes a shortened circadian period and reduced phase-shift to early-night light pulse associated with phase-advanced behavioral rhythms in the light-dark cycle. The A260T mutation is located in the phosphate loop of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain of CRY2. The mutation alters the conformation of CRY2, increasing its accessibility and affinity for FBXL3 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), thus promoting its degradation. These results demonstrate that CRY2 stability controlled by FBXL3 plays a key role in the regulation of human sleep wake behavior."

We identified a missense mutation in the human Cryptochrome 2 (<i>CRY2</i>) gene that co-segregates with FASP in one family. The mutation leads to replacement of an alanine residue at position 260 with a threonine (A260T). In mice, the <i>CRY2</i> mutation causes a shortened circadian period and reduced phase-shift to early-night light pulse associated with phase-advanced behavioral rhythms in the light-dark cycle. The A260T mutation is located in the phosphate loop of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain of CRY2. The mutation alters the conformation of CRY2, increasing its accessibility and affinity for FBXL3 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), thus promoting its degradation. These results demonstrate that CRY2 stability controlled by FBXL3 plays a key role in the regulation of human sleep wake behavior."

Sleep-wake timing is regulated by the internal biological clock driving physiological rhythms with a period of approximately 24\u2009hr (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takahashi, 1995</a>). The circadian clock is composed of interlocked transcriptional and translational negative feedback loops (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reppert and Weaver, 2001</a>). In mammals, a CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer binds to E-boxes and activates gene expression of the <i>Period (Per</i>) and <i>Cryptochrome (Cry</i>) genes. Translated PERs and CRYs proteins form a complex that enters the nucleus to inhibit their own transcription through direct interaction with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers. PER and CRY proteins accumulating in the nucleus are then degraded over time. As protein levels fall (depending on rate of degradation), the transcription-translation feedback loop begins anew."

While Drosophila and plant CRY proteins act as photoreceptors contributing to photoentrainment of the circadian clock and other biological processes by binding to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Partch and Sancar, 2005</a>), mammalian CRY2 has light-independent transcriptional repressor activity and strongly inhibits E-box-regulated gene expression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Griffin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kume et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shearman et al., 2000</a>). The protein stability of CRY2 is fine-tuned by post-translational modification including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. In addition, various enzyme modifications play a role in CRY2 regulation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Reischl and Kramer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stojkovic et al., 2014</a>). Among them, FBXL3 is an F-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase which promotes CRY1 and CRY2 ubiquitylation thus leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Busino et al., 2007</a>). Mutations in mouse <i>Fbxl3</i> or knockout of the <i>Fbxl3</i> gene dramatically lengthens the period of mouse behavioral rhythms in constant darkness (<a href=\"#bib5\">Godinho et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hirano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Siepka et al., 2007</a>), indicating that the protein stability of CRY1 and CRY2 is a critical determinant of circadian period in mice.

The FASP phenotype can segregate as a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant trait in human kindreds. Previously, we have identified mutations in clock genes, including <i>Period2, Period3, casein kinase I\u03b4</i>, and <i>Dec2</i> causing circadian and sleep homeostasis phenotypes in humans (<a href=\"#bib8\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Toh et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>). A mutation at the phosphorylation priming site of PER2 attenuates sequential phosphorylation and consequently destabilizes PER2 proteins. The mouse model expressing mutant PER2 exhibits a shortened circadian period accompanied with large phase-advance in sleep-wake rhythms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2007</a>). This sequential phosphorylation region of PER2 was later found to be modulated by another post-translational regulation, <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation, demonstrating an interplay and competition between phosphorylation and <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation of serine residues in this region (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kaasik et al., 2013</a>). These studies highlighted the important role of post-translational regulation of clock proteins\u00a0in vivo\u00a0in humans and also revealed mechanistic insight into the regulation of PER2. Thus, human genetic studies have provided valuable and unique opportunities to elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of circadian/sleep regulation."

Generation of a mouse model carrying the mutation revealed that the mutation causes a FASP-like phenotype in mice with altered circadian period and photic entrainment. We found that the mutation in the CRY2 FAD-binding-domain enhances its affinity for FBXL3, thus destabilizing CRY2 via increased ubiquitylation and targeting for degradation by the proteasome. We conclude that regulation of CRY2 stability by a proper balance of FAD and FBXL3 is essential for the sleep-wake cycle in humans."

                                "text": "We next analyzed voluntary wheel-running activity to evaluate phase-shift and free-running period of the circadian clock for the Tg mouse models. Similar to locomotor activity measured by video tracking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), wheel-running activity offset times were advanced in h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> vs. h<i>CRY2-WT</i> in LD on both m<i>Cry2</i> WT and null backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 2</a>), while there are no significant differences in activity onset time and acrophase. Interestingly, h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> showed reduced phase-delay when mice were subjected to a 30-min light pulse at ZT14 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>), whereas phase-advance was normal in response to a light pulse at ZT22 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 3</a>). Thus, mutant mice have reduced sensitivity to entrainment by light at early night compared to control mice. The mice were subsequently released into constant darkness (DD) to determine circadian period. The free-running period of h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> (23.52\u00b10.04\u2009hr) was significantly shorter than that of h<i>CRY2-WT</i> (23.70\u00b10.03\u2009hr) and <i>WT</i> mice (23.74\u00b10.02\u2009hr) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The period shortening phenotype was further enhanced by crossing Tg mice onto the m<i>Cry2</i> null background (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 4A</a>). The shorter circadian period and reduced phase-delay were also observed in another mutant line (23.51\u00b10.06\u2009hr) with a higher mutant transgene copy number (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">4B</a>), thus excluding the possibility that the phenotype was due to positional effects of the transgene insertion site in the genome. Of note, there is no significant difference in the periods and phase-shifting of h<i>CRY2-WT</i> transgenic vs. transgene negative mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), indicating that the shortening of circadian period and abnormal phase-delay are not simply due to overexpression of h<i>CRY2</i>. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the phase-advances in mice and humans results from the <i>CRY2</i> mutation. Data from the transgenic mice suggests that the phase advance may be due to a combination of shortened period and altered sensitivity to photic entrainment."

Consistent with the behavioral rhythms, shortened clock period was observed in PER2::LUC bioluminescence rhythms of liver and lung cultures from h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> vs. WT mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The peak and trough time of the bioluminescence rhythms were advanced in both tissues of h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice, suggesting that phase of the peripheral clock is also advanced by the mutation in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Circadian period shortening by the A260T mutation was also found using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice with a mutant vs. WT transgene on both WT and m<i>Cry2</i> knockout backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). In addition, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing CRY2-A260T also displayed a shorter circadian period than CRY2-WT expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), emphasizing the dominant effect of CRY2-A260T on the circadian period. Our results indicate that CRY2-A260T shortens the circadian period in both central and peripheral clocks, consistent with current understanding that core clock genes such as <i>Cry2</i> influence physiologies in multiple mammalian organ systems."

                                "text": "The CRY2 Ala260 residue resides in the \u2018phosphate loop\u2019 responsible for binding to the phosphate of FAD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hitomi et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mutations at amino acid residues critical for FAD binding affect CRY2 repressor activity of E-box-mediated transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Czarna et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hitomi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sanada et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, Ser265 of mouse CRY2 (homologous residue of Ser266 in human CRY2) is a phosphorylation site, and the S265D mutation, mimicking a phosphorylated serine 265, reduces CRY2 repressor activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sanada et al., 2004</a>). Using a Luciferase assay, we found that the A260T mutation weakened CRY2 repressor activity on <i>Per1</i> E-box-mediated transcriptional activation by CLOCK-BMAL1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, the nuclear CRY2 protein levels in culture cells were decreased by the mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which could potentially account for the reduction of CRY2 repressor activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We then examined the degradation of CRY2 proteins by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. Consistent with the cellular distribution of CRY2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), CRY2-A260T was less stable than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells, especially in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Destabilization of CRY2 by the mutation was further verified in a CRY2-LUC based bioluminescence degradation assay, where the protein decay rate can be determined by recording CRY2-LUC bioluminescence in culture (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hirano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A</a>). Although Ala260 does not directly bind to FAD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hitomi et al., 2009</a>), amino acid conversion from the hydrophobic and small amino acid, alanine, to threonine could alter the conformation of the phosphate loop. This idea is supported by an observation that a mutation from alanine to aspartic acid (A260D) caused a more severe effect on CRY2 repressor activity and protein stability than the A260T mutation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A,B</a>). We found that human CRY1 harboring the corresponding mutation at position 241 is less stable than CRY1-WT, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for CRY1 and CRY2 by FAD binding (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1C</a>). These results indicate that the conformation of the phosphate loop may play critical roles in regulating CRY2 stability and repressor activity."

As anticipated, h<i>FBXL3</i> knockdown in HEK293 cells increased the stability of both CRY2-WT and CRY2-A260T.

We found that treatment of HEK293 cells with FAD increased CRY2-WT protein levels much more than CRY2-A260T (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that stabilization of CRY2 by FAD was reduced by the mutation. This result supports the hypothesis that the A260T mutation alters the FBXL3-CRY2 interaction. We thus carried out a competitive assay by adding FAD to complexed CRY2-FBXL3 to examine the effect of the mutation on the release of CRY2 from purified CRY2-FBXL3 complexes in vitro. Free CRY2-WT protein levels increased with addition of FAD in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, mutant CRY2 was released less readily than CRY2-WT from the complexes even though both forms of CRY2 were bound to FBXL3 at the same level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In addition, we tested FBXL3-mediated CRY2 degradation using KL001, a small synthetic molecule known to stabilize CRY1 and CRY2 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</a>) due to its structural similarity to FAD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nangle et al., 2013</a>). KL001 stabilizes CRY2-WT in a dose-dependent manner as was previously reported (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</a>). However, KL001 failed to stabilize CRY2-A260T to the same extent it did for CRY2-WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A</a>). These results indicate that the A260T mutation weakened the function of FAD and KL001 as inhibitors of FBXL3-mediated degradation of CRY2 and that CRY2-A260T is less stable than CRY-WT, likely due to strengthened interaction with FBXL3. To determine whether the A260T mutation indeed modifies the interaction of CRY2 and FBXL3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As expected, CRY2-A260T binds more strongly to FBXL3 than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), consequently leading to more ubiquitylation of the mutant protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). The effect of the mutation on the binding affinity under in vivo conditions will need to be further evaluated when better human CRY2 antibodies (for immunoprecipitation) become available."

The published CRY2-FBXL3 structure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xing et al., 2013</a>) revealed that space between Ala260 (corresponding to A259T in mouse) and Asp442 (mouse Asp441) in FBXL3-binding form (red) is more opened vs. the FAD-binding form (orange, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure\u00a05\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1B</a>). The amino acid change from Ala260 to Thr increases molecular density in this space and may alter electrostatic interactions between Ala260Thr and Asp442. As a result, the mutation likely renders the CRY2-A260T more accessible to FBXL3 binding (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1C</a>).

Taken together, we demonstrated that the A260T mutation in the FAD binding pocket endows mutant CRY2 with a higher accessibility and affinity for FBXL3, therefore leading to faster proteasomal degradation of mutant vs. wild-type CRY2."

To examine the protein levels of mutant vs. wild-type CRY2 under physiological conditions, we used MEFs prepared from transgenic mice. Total protein levels of endogenous CRY2 were significantly lower in synchronized cells derived from h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> vs. h<i>CRY2-WT</i> mice at two different time points (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), even though <i>Cry2</i> transcript levels in h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice was higher than in h<i>CRY2-WT</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Similarly, CRY2 protein levels from liver nuclear extracts were lower in h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> vs. h<i>CRY2-WT</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), while h<i>CRY2</i> mRNA levels were higher in mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). CRY1 protein levels were also decreased by the mutation in nuclear extracts from liver (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), suggesting that CRY1 is destabilized in h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice. At the same time, we found that nuclear expression of PER1 and PER2 were up-regulated in liver extracts from mutant mice, particularly at ZT14 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), suggesting that the timing of nuclear accumulation of PER proteins is advanced in h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice. Although PER1 and PER2 protein levels were significantly altered, their mRNA levels were not different (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). A similar alteration of PER1 and PER2 protein levels in the absence of noticeable changes in mRNA levels was previously reported for <i>Psttm</i> mutant mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yoo et al., 2013</a>). <i>Psttm</i> mice have a mutation in the <i>Fbxl21</i> gene and this mutation decreases the protein level of FBXL21, which functionally competes with FBXL3. The <i>Psttm</i> mutation resulted in CRY1 and CRY2 protein destabilization and a shorter circadian period in mice (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yoo et al., 2013</a>), which parallels the phenotype of our h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We found that the expression of clock genes in liver was not significantly altered by the mutation, while the effect was obvious in MEFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1</a>). This is congruent with a previous suggestion that the effect of the CRY2 destabilization has diverged among different tissues (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hirano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yoo et al., 2013</a>). Collectively, we demonstrated that the A260T mutation destabilizes CRY2 proteins in vivo likely through alteration of FBXL3-mediated CRY2 degradation, leading to perturbation of the circadian clock."

Considering his age, we classified him as \u2018unknown\u2019, since adolescents and young adults are typically more difficult to categorize as having a definite circadian phenotype due to normal phase delays seen in many people beginning in adolescence and persisting into young adult life (boys/men &gt; than girls/women) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Roenneberg et al., 2004</a>). When phenotyped at age 21, subject 101374 was at the statistical peak age of maximum phase delay due to these developmental effects and was prone to be even more phase-delayed by his male sex. Therefore, he may become progressively more phase advanced as he grows older as a result of the <i>CRY2</i> FASP allele as it is unmasked by these developmental changes. It is also possible that the mutation may not have 100% penetrance and therefore the nephew will never manifest the FASP trait."

Consistent with the other FASP mutations previously reported in h<i>CK1\u03b4</i> and h<i>PER3,</i> the effects of the human mutation observed in mouse models and in vitro are subtle compared to those found in forward mutagenesis screens. This is expected since the mutations that we identified are found in extant humans in the \u2018real world\u2019. The circadian body clock plays crucial roles in maintaining normal physiological functions. Thus, any mutation manifesting the strong phenotypes seen in mutagenesis screens would almost certainly have been a selective disadvantage if they arose spontaneously in humans. Furthermore, while the phase advance in mice carrying the human <i>PER2</i> mutation appears to be due largely to a shortening of circadian period, the published <i>PER3</i> mice and the <i>CRY2</i> mice reported here both have altered entrainment. We speculate that some of FASP in humans is caused by altered entrainment properties that would not have been detected in forward mutagenesis screens because they have focused almost entirely on measuring period (not phase) as the target phenotype."

Although wheel-running also displays the phase advance of activity offset in the h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the data from wheel-running is less robust for detecting a phase advance of activity onset. This is likely due to a strong light-masking effect for mouse at the light-to-dark transition for activity onset. Thus, when the lights are on, mice are less likely to run on a wheel. However, smaller amplitude movements like grooming behavior and moving in the cage were detected by video recording. Wheel running was quite sensitive to detect phase advance of activity offset as this is seen during the dark phase of LD 12:12."

Consistent with this model, our human mutation destabilizes CRY2 and leads to a short circadian period of mouse behavioral rhythms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Shortened circadian periods have been measured in one FASP human subject\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Jones et al., 1999</a>), and in mouse models of human FASP mutations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2005</a>).

In order to live on a 24\u2009hr day in LD 12:12, wild-type mice need to phase delay a small amount each day because the endogenous circadian period is slightly shorter than 24\u2009hr. A reduced ability to phase-delay observed in the h<i>CRY2-A260T</i> mouse model could contribute to advanced sleep phase, though the mechanism for the altered phase-shift remains to be elucidated. Although the difference in the free-running period of the transgenic mice was subtle as compared to the degree of phase-advance manifested in human mutation carriers or mice carrying the mutant h<i>PER2</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,F</a>), it is reasonable to expect that the alteration of both circadian period and light-induced phase-shifting together will strongly influence the phase angle of entrainment. The <i>after-hours</i> mutation in the mouse <i>Fbxl3</i> gene causes stabilization of CRY leading to an extremely long circadian period (<a href=\"#bib5\">Godinho et al., 2007</a>). These mutant mice also exhibit large phase-shifts in response to light (<a href=\"#bib7\">Guilding et al., 2013</a>).

However, the ability of mammalian CRYs as a photoreceptor remains controversial as double knockout mice of <i>Cry1</i> and <i>Cry2</i> are still able to entrain to light and show <i>Per1</i> gene induction in SCN in response to light pulses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Okamura et al., 1999</a>). These double knockout mice completely lack behavioral rhythms in constant darkness (<a href=\"#bib42\">van der Horst et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, the repressor activity of CRY on E-boxes and its interaction with other clock proteins are independent of light (<a href=\"#bib6\">Griffin et al., 1999</a>). These findings emphasize the light-independent role of CRY proteins in mammals. Thus, the physiological role of FAD binding in the mammalian clock has been totally unknown, while a previous study implied that FAD can structurally compete with FBXL3. Our findings provide the first evidence that FAD functions as a stabilizer of CRY2 protein by modulating FBXL3-CRY2 interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The results presented here demonstrate that the protein stability of CRY2 regulated by the balance of FBXL3 and FAD controls clock speed and sleep/wake timing in mice and humans."

Although psychiatric disorders, cancer, and metabolic disorders are tightly connected with dysfunction of the biological clock, associations of <i>CRY2</i> polymorphisms with morning/evening preference or other circadian phenotypes have not been described. One polymorphism in the <i>FBXL3</i> gene was reported to be associated with diurnal preference (<a href=\"#bib25\">Parsons et al., 2014</a>), implying the conserved role of FBXL3 in the human circadian clock. However, it remains to be elucidated whether that variant in <i>FBXL3</i> is causative (vs. merely be associated with) the human circadian phenotype and whether it acts through CRY regulation. Here, we demonstrate that regulatory mechanisms for CRY2 protein are well conserved between mice and humans and that control of CRY2 stability is critical for appropriate phase angle and period of the circadian clock in humans."

Briefly, a linear PCR fragment containing a streptomycin/kanamycin counter selection gene was amplified. The primers for this reaction were designed so that 20 nucleotides would anneal to the streptomycin/kanamycin gene and an additional 40 nucleotides homologous to sequences flanking the mutation site. This PCR product was transferred into the RP11-1084E2 BAC to initiate homologous recombination in the DH10B <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain that already contained the plasmid pSC101- BAD-gbaA<sup>tet</sup>. The counter selection gene was then removed by a second recombination event using an oligonucleotide carrying the mutation (G-to-A) in the center. All relevant segments generated by PCR and recombination were sequence confirmed. Detailed mapping was carried out for the modified BACs to ensure that correct constructs were obtained. Transgenic mice were generated using standard microinjection procedures. The transgenic founders were on a C57BL/6 \u00d7 SJL F<sub>1</sub> background and were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice in successive generations. The copy number for each transgenic line was calculated by quantitative real-time PCR using common sequences for mouse <i>Cry2</i> (reference) and human <i>CRY2</i> genes."

No statistical analysis was used to predetermine the sample sizes. Experiments were not randomized and not analyzed blindly. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1</a>, the sample with extremely abnormal walking distance (&gt;500 meter walking distance, due to a failure of automatic video tracking) was excluded as an outlier according to the Smirnov-Grubbs test. Data was statistically analyzed using R software (RRID <a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905\">SCR_001905</a>). To assess statistical significance, data was obtained from three or more independent experiments. All data sets were assumed to follow normal distributions by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and homogeneity of variance between compared groups was tested by F-test (comparison of 2 groups) or Bartlett test (comparison of multiple groups). Two-tailed paired Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test or Welch\u2019s <i>t</i>-test was used for the comparison of 2 groups with or without homogeneity of variance. Tukey\u2019s test or Games-Howell test were used for multiple comparisons with or without of homogeneity of variance. Differences with a p value &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant."

A mouse model carrying the candidate variant exhibits modest shortening of the circadian period as well as altered phase delay, but not phase advance. At the molecular level, the authors provide evidence for altered protein stability of Cry2 due to the mutation. At the molecular level, the authors demonstrate shorter PER2-driven bioluminescence rhythms in the peripheral oscillators. Importantly, the authors examine the impact of the CRY2 mutation on the normally repressing function of the protein, and demonstrate a possible mechanism through altered interaction with a known binding partner, FBXL3. The results provide insight into the regulation of human sleep timing. However, several of the authors' claims are compromised somewhat by an inconsistent quality in the data. Some revisions are required before a conclusion can be reached on whether all of the authors' claims can be supported."

Similarly, poor rhythms in NIH3T3 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) make these results hard to interpret.

To assess the effect of KL001, the data should be presented as difference in half-life compared to the no-drug control for each construct. Interaction of Cry2 with Fbxl3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) should be confirmed in a physiologically relevant setting (co-immunoprecipitation from transgenic cells/tissues and/or Cry2-deficient cells reconstituted with either Cry2 form, see previous comment)."

That\u2019s why we generated the mouse model and characterized their behavior to see how A260T mutation affects behavioral and cellular rhythms on a homogeneous genetic background. One thing that we\u2019ve learned from study of familial human behavioral traits is the challenge of recruiting additional family members. Sleep is NOT a disease phenotype, so people are not as motivated to participate with all the questionnaires, interviews, and tests that we would like them to do, especially when they are not getting paid for any of these. In order to overcome this challenge, our approach has been trying our best to recruit as many subjects as possible in each family followed by mutation screening. Proving that a mutation is causal requires demonstration of the behavioral phenotype in a mouse model and the altered molecular functions in vitro/in vivo. If the family has many mutation carriers who have the sleep trait but the mouse model does not demonstrate the phenotype, then we cannot follow up with the mutation even if the number of mutation carriers is higher."

However, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A-C</a> shows the advanced \u201clocomotor\u201d activity onset by video recording. Thus, we think that while CRY2-A260T Tg mice wake earlier than WT mice, they are not running on the wheel, likely due to masking to light. In addition, the inconsistency among the analysis tools can be explained by the fact that wheel-running exercise alters mouse behavioral rhythms (Webb et al., Behavioral Neuroscience, 2014) (especially shortens the free-running period). Thus, wheel-running does not reflect the \u201csleep-wake\u201d pattern perfectly. We also need to remember that humans do not run on wheels all day long, so wheel-running behavior is likely not the best reflection of human sleep wake behavior. We discussed these points and also the differences in the phenotype of our mice in the Discussion section. Also, we understand so little about the relationship between period length and phase angle of entrainment to speak with too much certainty about what is expected in terms of phase advance for any given endogenous period. We accept that there are differences between mouse and human physiology. The conditions under which we measure such things is also different in mice than in humans (see above). Finally, it is also possible that the phase advance in the humans is due to a combination of effects of period shortening and altered entrainment. We have attempted to enroll these subjects in studies in temporal isolation by our collaborator, Jeanne Duffy. Unfortunately, these subjects did not want to do such an intensive study. We did observed abnormal phase-shifting in the mice, which also is likely to contribute to the phenotype."

The recapitulation of a circadian phenotype led to us to the more detailed molecular analysis showing functional consequences in vitro.
