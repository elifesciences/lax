                    "text": "V1 and V2b interneurons (INs) are essential for the production of an alternating flexor\u2013extensor motor output. Using a tripartite genetic system to selectively ablate either V1 or V2b INs in the caudal spinal cord and assess their specific functions in awake behaving animals, we find that V1 and V2b INs function in an opposing manner to control flexor\u2013extensor-driven movements. Ablation of V1 INs results in limb hyperflexion, suggesting that V1 IN-derived inhibition is needed for proper extension movements of the limb. The loss of V2b INs results in hindlimb hyperextension and a delay in the transition from stance phase to swing phase, demonstrating V2b INs are required for the timely initiation and execution of limb flexion movements. Our findings also reveal a bias in the innervation of flexor- and extensor-related motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs that likely contributes to their differential actions on flexion\u2013extension movements."

Using a tripartite genetic system to selectively ablate either V1 or V2b INs in the caudal spinal cord and assess their specific functions in awake behaving animals, we find that V1 and V2b INs function in an opposing manner to control flexor\u2013extensor-driven movements. Ablation of V1 INs results in limb hyperflexion, suggesting that V1 IN-derived inhibition is needed for proper extension movements of the limb. The loss of V2b INs results in hindlimb hyperextension and a delay in the transition from stance phase to swing phase, demonstrating V2b INs are required for the timely initiation and execution of limb flexion movements. Our findings also reveal a bias in the innervation of flexor- and extensor-related motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs that likely contributes to their differential actions on flexion\u2013extension movements."

When an animal is walking these two sets of muscles contract repeatedly, one after the other. Inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord coordinate these walking movements by preventing the flexor or extensor muscles from contracting at the same time. In 2014, researchers discovered that two groups of inhibitory neurons, known as the V1 and V2b interneurons, are essential for this alternating pattern of flexing and extending of the limbs of newborn mice. However, these experiments were not able to assess the particular contribution that the V1 and V2b neurons each make to limb movements."

Charles <a href=\"#bib64\">Sherrington (1906)</a> first demonstrated that all such motor behaviors rely on the reciprocal actions of flexor and extensor muscles around each limb joint and that terrestrial animals require reciprocal inhibition to move and articulate their limbs. It is known that reciprocal flexor\u2013extensor motor activity is produced by inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord, many of which appear to be core components of the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib41\">Kiehn, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goulding, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arber, 2012</a>).

The most prominent of these are reciprocal Ia inhibitory interneurons (IaINs), which are activated by muscle spindle afferents and inhibit antagonist motor neurons. IaINs are rhythmically active during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feldman and Orlovsky, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pratt and Jordan, 1987</a>) and scratching (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deliagina and Orlovsky, 1980</a>). Peak IaIN activity coincides with the phase in which antagonist motor neurons are hyperpolarized (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pratt and Jordon, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Geertsen et al., 2011</a>). This activity profile is strong evidence of a central role in reciprocal inhibition. The contribution that non-reciprocal inhibitory Ib interneurons (IbINs) make to locomotion is less clear. While the IbINs that are innervated by Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) generally inhibit homonymous motor neurons under non-locomotor conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jankowska, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pearson and Collins, 1993</a>), during locomotion the Ib pathway exerts an excitatory effect on extensor motor activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Conway et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pearson and Collins, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gossard et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Angel et al., 2005</a>). Nonetheless, inhibition mediated by IbINs has been observed during the extension phase of walking in humans (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shoji et al., 2005</a>). This inhibition is associated with the unloading of the limb, and it suggests that IbINs may contribute to the phase transition from stance (extension) to swing (flexion). The role that Renshaw cells play in shaping flexor\u2013extensor locomotor activity appears to be more limited (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pratt and Jordan, 1987</a>). While these cells are rhythmically active during locomotor activity, reducing Renshaw cell transmission by pharmacological or genetic blockade of cholinergic transmission changes the periodicity of the locomotor rhythm with little discernible effect on flexor\u2013extensor alternation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Noga et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Myers et al., 2005</a>)."

Among these are three prominent populations of ipsilaterally projecting inhibitory interneurons: dorsal Lbx1-derived inhibitory INs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gross et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tripodi et al., 2011</a>) and ventral V1 and V2b INs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Saueressig et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sapir et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). The V1 and V2b IN populations are both heterogeneous, being made up of multiple physiological cell types including Renshaw cells (V1 INs), IaINs (V1 and V2b INs) and putative IbINs (V2b INs) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sapir et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3a\">Alvarez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), as well as other as yet unidentified inhibitory cell types. Recently, we have found that the composite activities of the V1 and V2b INs are required to secure flexor\u2013extensor alternation in the in vitro neonatal spinal cord and in newborn mice (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). This finding is consistent with our demonstration that cells with the features of IaINs are derived from both V1 and V2b INs and that disynaptic reciprocal inhibition is only abolished when both of these populations are functionally inactivated (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>)."

In particular, we were interested in determining whether these two inhibitory interneuron classes control discrete aspects of limb movement with regard to flexor\u2013extensor-driven motor behaviors. Our results demonstrate a striking functional bias in the actions of V1 and V2b INs on flexor\u2013extensor motor activity, whereby the selective ablation of V1 vs V2b INs results in hindlimb hyperflexion and hyperextension, respectively. This functional bias was observed both in air-stepping juvenile mice and in adult animals performing motor tasks such as over-ground walking. In analyzing the inhibitory inputs to motor neurons from these two interneuron populations, we find a genetically defined bias in V1 and V2b connectivity that likely underpins the differential effects on flexor\u2013extensor motor activity. Specifically, a higher proportion of the inhibitory contacts on flexor motor neurons come from V1 INs as compared to extensor motor neurons, whereas V2b INs preferentially contact motor neurons that innervate extensor muscles."

Control mice displayed a regular alternating pattern of EMG activity in both muscles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) in which there was little or no overlap in TA and GS burst activity. This profile of TA-flexor and GS-extensor activity in control P7 mice is very similar to that seen in adult mice (see also <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), where longer duration GS bursts are interspersed with short TA bursts. The GS extensor phase was also seen to increase proportionately with longer step periods, while the TA flexor burst period was constant across all stepping speeds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>). This is in strong agreement with previous studies performed in rodents and cats (<a href=\"#bib26\">Grillner, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Halbertsma, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Juvin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frigon and Gossard, 2009</a>) showing that changes in duration of the extensor/stance phase are preferentially responsible for lengthening or shortening the step cycle."

This finding is consistent with the idea that depleting V1 IN inhibition causes a preferential degradation of inhibition to TA flexor motor neurons. The increase in TA burst duration also caused a moderate lengthening of the step cycle period in V1 IN-ablated mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). V2b IN-depleted mice displayed a strikingly different pattern of EMG activity during airstepping. In addition to an aggregate slowing of the motor rhythm, the duration of GS extensor muscle activity was markedly elongated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>) when compared to control and V1 IN-ablated animals. This slowing of the motor rhythm following the loss of V2b INs can largely be attributed to the increased duration of GS extensor activity, as the TA flexor bursts were similar in length to those seen in control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that a flexor-dominant motor rhythm emerges when V1 INs are deleted, while the loss of V2b INs gives rise to an extensor-dominant motor rhythm."

The increased frequency of deletions in the V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) coupled with the changes in phase duration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), strongly suggest that inhibition from V1 and V2b INs facilitates the transition from swing to stance and from stance to swing, respectively. Our observation that the deletions in both V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice fall into the non-resetting category strongly suggests that both of these genetically defined cell populations are involved in pattern formation rather than rhythm generation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea, 2005</a>)."

The increase in GS EMG activity during stance phase appears to be a late behavioral modification that facilitates the opening of the ankle joint during walking, as it is not seen during the early phase of V1 IN ablation (see <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The co-activation of the TA and GS muscles was even more pronounced during swimming with EMG analysis revealing synchronous TA and GS muscle activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, middle panel, asterisk) that causes the extension of the hindlimbs to be aborted during the power stroke. One factor that may contribute to the synchronous flexor\u2013extensor activity seen during swimming may be the reduction in sensory feedback from GTOs that has been shown to occur (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akay et al., 2014</a>). In V1 IN-ablated mice that lack sensory feedback gated by the V1 INs, the likely loss of Ib-mediated sensory inhibition during swimming could account for the observed co-activation of flexor\u2013extensor muscles and abortive hindlimb movements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

Kinematic analysis of walking V1 IN-ablated mice revealed two factors that contribute to rear paw overshoot: (1) an increase in the speed and degree of ankle flexion movements during swing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and (2) an increase in the angular rotation of the pelvis during stepping (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Unfortunately, we were unable to perform a similar analysis of the early motor deficits that occur in adult V2b IN-ablated animals, as treating these animals with a single high dose of DTX caused bowel blockage and increased morbidity. This is likely to be due to the expression of Gata3 in a subset of enteric neurons. Whereas control mice (n = 5 animals) displayed a highly reproducible pattern of EMG activity both before and after DTX treatment, with the iliopsoas (IP) and TA muscles only being active during the swing phase of the step cycle (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, upper left panel), the depletion of V1 INs (n = 6 animals) resulted in ectopic IP and TA muscle EMG activity within 5 days of DTX treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, upper panel). This ectopic TA and IP muscle activity was even more pronounced 7 days after DTX treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, upper panel), with the TA muscle being co-active during stance with the GS muscle (see bars). A similar expansion of IP activity was observed, although to a less extent than that seen in the TA (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, arrowhead). We posit that the co-activation of the TA and IP muscles during stance constitutes the underlying mechanism that restricts the hip and ankle joints from opening during walking, and it also contributes to the postural changes that occur in V1 IN-ablated mice following DTX treatment. By contrast, there was no increase in GS activity during the swing/flexor phase indicating the loss of V1 INs has an effect on ankle flexor but not extensor activity during walking."

During the early phase of V1 IN cell loss (5 days p.i.), the ankle joint angle at maximal flexion was reduced from 40\u00b0 to less than 30\u00b0 (lower middle panel). There was also a progressive decrease in maximal extension of the ankle joint in early swing phase (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, lower panels, asterisks).

To test this, we took advantage of the neonatal spinal cord preparation, which can be induced to produce fictive locomotion in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">Kiehn, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goulding, 2009</a>) and is amenable to optogenetic manipulation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hagglund et al., 2010</a>). Spinal cords from P0-P1 <i>Gata3</i><sup>Cre</sup>; <i>R26</i><sup>lsl-ChR2</sup> (<i>Ai32</i>) pups displayed a characteristic alternating pattern of L2 flexor-related and L5 extensor-related locomotor rhythm in the presence of NMDA and 5-HT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>, n = 6/6 cords). However, upon activating channelrhodopsin in V2b INs, there was a strong and highly selective decrease in extensor-related motor activity as measured by extracellular recordings from the L5 ventral root (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>, bar). By contrast, L2 flexor-related motor activity remained largely unchanged following V2b IN activation, although there was some disturbance in the coherence of the motor rhythm. Activation of V1 INs had a more pronounced effect on the motor rhythm, in that it completely suppressed L2 flexor-related and L5 extensor-related rhythmic bursting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, bar, n = 5/5 cords). This is likely to be due to the activation of Renshaw cells, which are known to strongly inhibit motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Windhorst, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhumbra et al., 2014</a>). In summary, the suppression of extensor-related L5 motor activity in the in vitro spinal cord preparation when V2b INs are activated provides strong evidence that V2b INs can functionally inhibit extensor-related motor activity during locomotion. This finding is consistent with the expansion of extensor motor neuron activity that we see following V2b IN ablation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>)."

These systems all have drawbacks. Approaches using tetanus toxin are often non-inducible, while ligand-mediated silencing using Gi-coupled receptors can be highly variable and difficult to quantify. By contrast, DTR-mediated neuronal ablation has the advantage of being highly quantifiable, and the timing of cell killing can also be controlled to minimize potential developmental changes due to the chronic silencing or ablation of cells at early developmental times (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gosgnach et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Most importantly, by using an intersectional approach to restrict DTR expression to the caudal CNS, we were able to spare essential functions such as respiration and chewing. With further refinements, this intersectional system can be used to target and ablate discrete populations of neurons, including genetically defined subsets of V1 and V2b INs."

In the <i>Xenopus</i> tadpole, V1 (aIN) cells promote the transition between the active and inactive phases of the swimming rhythm by providing early phase inhibition to motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib46\">Li et al., 2004</a>). The CiA cells, which are homologous to the V1 INs, are likely to function in a similar fashion in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib33\">Higashijima et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, we see an increase in the incidence of GS (extensor) EMG deletions in airstepping mice that lack V1 INs, suggesting the transition from flexion to extension is compromised (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Interestingly, these deletions, and the flexor deletions that arise from the loss of the V2b INs, resemble non-resetting deletions in the cat and turtle (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grillner and Zangger, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Stein, 2008</a>). The absence of resetting deletions suggests both populations belong to the pattern forming, rather than rhythm generating, layer of the locomotor CPG. Moreover, the opposing nature of the deletions that occur when V1 vs V2b INs are inactivated suggests that the differential silencing of these two inhibitory cell populations may contribute to the valence of corrective reflexes such as the stumbling corrective reaction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Forssberg, 1979</a>) and crossed extension reflex (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sherrington, 1910</a>)."

First, biased inputs from the V1 and V2b INs would facilitate the graded activation of synergist and antagonist motor neurons. This graded recruitment of antagonist flexor\u2013extensor motor neurons would be expected to play an important role in modulating limb stiffness and compliance, which is necessary for smooth movements and postural control. Second, the co-innervation of flexor and extensor motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs would enable motor neurons to actively summate and compare inhibitory inputs that are differentially gated by these two inhibitory interneuron populations."

Our observation that V1 and V2b INs are the sole source of Ia inhibition to motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>) suggests that they make a major contribution to inhibitory push\u2013pull conductances.

These findings argue that the V1 and V2b INs can function in a redundant manner to produce a grossly alternating flexor\u2013extensor locomotor output, and they are in general agreement with the mixed innervation of flexor and extensor motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>)."

This functional recovery is suggestive of a degree of plasticity in the inhibitory control of flexor\u2013extensor movements by both inhibitory populations. Interestingly, the functional deficits that persist after ablating the V1 INs are more pronounced than those found following V2b IN ablation. This might be attributable to the relative abundance of these two cell types in the lumbar spinal cord, where there are twice as many V1 INs as compared to V2b INs (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Differences in the axonal morphology of V1 and V2b INs may also contribute to the persistent hindlimb hyperflexion phenotype V1 IN-ablated mice display, as the motor pools innervating hip and ankle flexors tend to be skewed rostrally in the lumbar spinal cord when compared to their extensor antagonist motor pools (<a href=\"#bib51\">McHanwell and Biscoe, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yakovenko et al., 2002</a>). In this context, it is worth noting that V2b INs predominantly project their axons caudally (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and may therefore have a limited capacity to substitute for those V1 INs that have rostrally projecting axons. In addition to this, there are fewer inhibitory contacts from V2b INs onto flexor motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, the V2b IN-ablated mice regain a large measure of normal limb movement in the aftermath of V2b IN ablation. In this instance, V1 INs, many of which project caudally (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), may compensate for the initial loss of V2b IN-derived inhibitory inputs that are proportionately more abundant on extensor motor neurons."

Our characterization of presynaptic inputs to V1 and V2b INs showing the V2b INs receive inputs from neurons in the dorsal horn (F Stam and MG, unpublished findings) is a strong indication that inhibitory IbINs are derived from the V2b IN population. As such, the presumed loss of inhibitory IbINs that occurs when V2b INs are ablated could account for the delayed transition from stance to swing that we observe (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pearson, 2008</a>). The loss of IbINs in the V2b IN-ablated mice might also explain why these mice do not show any major change in GS and TA muscle activity during swimming, as Golgi tendon-derived sensory feedback is normally attenuated during this activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akay et al., 2014</a>)."

Our results are consistent with the V1 and V2b INs contributing to the dynamic control of limb movements during walking via their differential effects on flexor and extensor motor activity. It should be noted that the V1 and V2b IN populations are made up of multiple cell types and the respective contribution that each of these cell types make to flexor\u2013extensor-driven behaviors needs to be assessed. Future efforts to evaluate in depth how these two populations control flexor\u2013extensor motor behaviors will require a better understanding of the molecular, anatomical, and physiological diversity that exists within these two inhibitory IN populations, coupled with a detailed functional characterization of V1 and V2b IN subtypes."

Small black dots were made on the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, ankle, and paw to facilitate kinematic analysis. Locomotion was induced by injection of L-DOPA (100 \u03bcg/g body weight) subcutaneously into the nape of neck. Animals were immediately placed in a harness that supported the trunk while allowing free movement of the limbs. Airstepping typically commenced 10\u201315 min post-injection. High-speed video recordings (125 frames/s) of stable rhythmic locomotor activity were made over a 30-min period. Recordings of animals performing a stable sequence of stepping were selected for further kinematic analysis. Videos were digitized using MaxTRAQ software. To measure ankle muscle activity, two fine EMG recording electrodes were inserted into the TA and GS muscles of one hindlimb and EMG activity recorded during stable episodes of locomotion as described above."

They use elegant genetic techniques to ablate separately these two classes of interneurons from the subcervical spinal cord only in response to DTX injection. They assess the effects of these ablations with a battery of behavioral and electromyographic assays all in awake behaving mice (mainly neonatal). They find that V2b INs predominantly inhibit extensor motor neurons and cause hyperextension when ablated, whereas V1 INs predominantly inhibit flexor motor neurons and cause hyperflexion when ablated. They supplement this work and support these findings with optogenetic experiments in isolated neonatal spinal cord. They then perform anatomical analysis of contacts between each of these two classes of INs and motor neurons and show convincingly that V2b INs contact mainly but not exclusively extensor motor neurons and V1 INs contact mainly but not exclusively flexor motor neurons. Thus inhibitory innervation of motor neurons by these two classes of INs is differential but push-pull. These findings have very important implications for the functional organization of spinal motor circuits. The data set is extensive and thorough. The figures are clear and show necessary data; supplemental figures are extensive but useful. This paper will provoke wide interest among the readers of <i>eLife</i>."

We have included the additional references on Renshaw cells suggested by reviewer 2 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Noga et al., 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhumbra et al., 2014</a>), and a further reference to the study by <a href=\"#bib53\">Myers et al.

Admittedly there are short rhythmic bursts of GS muscle activity, however, these are severely truncated and in some instances are partially co-active with TA muscle activity. We would like to suggest that these short bursts of ankle extensor activity are insufficient for the full opening of the ankle joint. There is some opening, but this is rather limited. Likewise in the V2b IN-ablated animals we see very long bursts of GS extensor activity and a marked reduction in the duration and amplitude of TA activity, which is again consistent with there being very little movement around the ankle joint."

We believe that these differences are likely to be due to reduced Ib sensory feedback, which is known to promote extension and also strongly influence the transition from stance to swing during walking. In the absence of V1 inhibitory IN-mediated sensory feedback, attenuation of this pathway during swimming might remove the Ib sensory signals that suppress flexor activity during extension, as along with timing signals that are provided by Golgi tendon activity and possibly also cutaneous signals from the plantar surface of the foot. This point is raised again in the Discussion. The phase relationships between GS and TA are now provided in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."
