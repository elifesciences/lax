The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u201cSystematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells\u201d by Garnett and colleagues, published in <i>Nature</i> in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Garnett et al., 2012</a>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20. Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel interaction they identified in which Ewing\u2019s sarcoma cell lines showed an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature <i>EWS-FLI1</i> translocation, the hallmark of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma family tumors, exhibited increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown mediated by siRNA of <i>EWS-FLI1</i> abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u201cSystematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells\u201d by Garnett and colleagues, published in <i>Nature</i> in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Garnett et al., 2012</a>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20. Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel interaction they identified in which Ewing\u2019s sarcoma cell lines showed an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature <i>EWS-FLI1</i> translocation, the hallmark of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma family tumors, exhibited increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown mediated by siRNA of <i>EWS-FLI1</i> abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

This study leveraged a collection of over 600 cell lines screened across 130 drugs, with the aim to uncover new interactions between known cancers and known drugs in order to identify new potential therapeutic avenues using extant drugs. They captured a large number of known gene-drug interactions of clinically active drugs and identified several novel gene\u2013drug associations. The ability to accurately capture a large number of known clinically relevant drug response biomarkers as well as preferential cancer type sensitivities known to occur in the clinic, such as decreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors in <i>BRAF</i> mutant colorectal cancers relative\u00a0to melanomas, demonstrated the effectiveness of this large-scale pharmacogenomic approach. A similar approach of interrogating a large panel of human cancer cell lines of diverse lineages to predict drug sensitivity was conducted and reported by Barretina and colleagues at the same time (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barretina et al., 2012</a>)."

The <i>EWS-FLI1</i> translocation is a defining cytogenetic characteristic of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs). ESFTs are highly malignant tumors that occur in the bone and soft tissue, usually in children. The translocation event combines part of the EWS protein to a member of the <i>ETS</i> transcription factor family; in 90% of cases, this is FLI1. This creates a novel transcription factor, EWS-FLI1, whose oncogenic actions and mechanisms are still being fully explored. The translocation event is thought to be the initiating event for the development of ESFTs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Erkizan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Lessnick and Ladanyi, 2012</a>)."

PARP1 is a key component of single stranded break (SSB) repair; however, loss of PARP1 activity can be compensated for through DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR). This makes PARP1 an interesting therapeutic target in the context of malignancies with deficient HR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant breast and ovarian cancers. In these cancers, loss of PARP activity results in synthetic lethality; with both SSB and HR impaired, the accumulation of DNA damage eventually kills the tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lord et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Sonnenblick et al., 2014</a>).

The concentration of olaparib required to reduce colony formation by 90% or more was much less for Ewing\u2019s sarcoma cells (on par with the concentration required for the BRCA-deficient cell line) than for the non-Ewing\u2019s sarcoma cell lines.

In a previous paper, Brenner and colleagues reported that in prostate cancer PARP was a cofactor for wild-type <i>ETS</i> transcription factors, which makes up one half of the defining translocation-based fusion transcription factor of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, and that PARPi treatment of <i>ETS</i> positive prostate cancers disrupted their growth (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brenner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Legrand et al., 2013</a>). Based on this finding, they examined the role of PARP1 and PARPi in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. Using immunoprecipitation, they detected a direct interaction between the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcription factor and PARP1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brenner et al., 2012</a>). Further, they reported that transforming a cell line (in this case, PC3 cells) with the <i><b>EWS-FLI1</b></i> translocation conferred sensitivity to treatment with olaparib, and that siRNA mediated knockdown of <i><b>EWS-FLI1</b></i> inhibited transwell migration of ESFT derived cell lines, but not osteosarcoma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brenner et al., 2012</a>). Multiple groups have also reported the unique sensitivity of EWS-FLI1 carrying Ewing\u2019s sarcoma derived cell lines to olaparib (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Norris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). Additional work then demonstrated that, similar to breast and ovarian cancers harboring <i><b>BRCA1/2</b></i> mutations, Ewing\u2019s sarcomas may also have defects in DNA repair mechanisms, rendering them sensitive to PARP inhibition (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stewart et al., 2014</a>). This has led to the start of clinical trials treating Ewing\u2019s sarcoma patients with combination therapies targeting multiple DNA damage pathways and PARP inhibition. Results from a small scale nonrandomized phase II human trial failed to show clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent Ewing sarcoma treated with only olaparib (<a href=\"#bib4\">Choy et al., 2014</a>), but other trials are underway to explore the efficacy of PARP inhibition in combination with chemotherapy."

In the registered report the authors propose to reproduce a single finding that was presented in one of the main figures of the original report. While this finding is indeed an important part of the original study it does not embody a large part of the original conclusions: The original paper demonstrated that a drug screen performed across a large collection of cell lines was able to capture accurately a large number of known clinically relevant drug response biomarkers as well as preferential cancer type sensitivities known to occur in the clinic (for example that <i>BRAF</i> mutant colorectal cancers are less responsive to BRAF inhibitor than melanomas). It also showed that genomic modeling of the drug response could yield biological insights into drug mechanism of action (Elastic Net analysis outputs). This was distinct from previous smaller scale efforts (and also valuable for other uses) that had been reported prior to the original report (NCI60 results, for example). The reviewers encourage this Reproducibility Report after addressing the following concerns:"
