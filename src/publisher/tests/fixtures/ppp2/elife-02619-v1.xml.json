First, the editorial production team checks the files that have been submitted to our manuscript submission system, and also all the information about the authors and the article (that is, the metadata) that the authors have input during the submission process. This often involves corresponding with authors to clarify points and requesting further information or files. If the authors agree, the decision letter (which is based on the referee reports) and author response to this letter are also prepared for publication. Meanwhile, the <i>eLife</i> features team works with the authors to produce a plain-language summary of the article. The aim of this summary\u2014which is called an <i>eLife</i> Digest\u2014is to make the background and central findings of the article readily understandable by a broad readership. The fact that <i>eLife</i> is an open access journal already ensures that anyone who is interested in an article can read it free of charge."

I have deliberately avoided the term typesetter here because producing the PDF version of the article is just a small part of the whole production process today. This vendor converts the Word file submitted by the author, plus all the metadata\u2014such as the author names and affiliations, author contributions, keywords, funding details and so on\u2014into a XML file (see below). The figures, figure supplements, source data, videos and other subsidiary files are also resized and renamed. On completion of this process the content is pushed into an <a href=\"http://www.elifesciences.org/beyond-the-pdf-article-proof-2/\">online proofing service</a>, and authors are sent an email with a link that allows them to check their article. Authors can also download a PDF version of the proof, but all corrections have to be entered via the online proofing service."

Second, XML allows us to deliver our content to third-party sites such as PubMed and PubMed Central. Third, the availability of the XML versions of articles supports text and data mining."
