Another strip was probed with an antibody against the \u00b51 subunit of AP-1, but the reaction failed and no signal was produced. Because of a mix up of strips upon repeating the incubation with the anti-\u00b51 antibody, the strip that had been reacted with the anti-\u03b31 antibody was mistakenly used. The fourth panel shows the subsequent exposure, which reflects the signal from the previous probing with the \u03b31 subunit antibody, as we had not removed the previous signal. Because of an error with labeling the molecular weight marker, the panel is also inverted relative to the panel above it."
