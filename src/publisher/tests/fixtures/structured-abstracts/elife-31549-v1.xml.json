Peak gametocyte densities and gametocyte burden was highest in the LD-PIP/SP arm, and associated with the preceding asexual parasite biomass (p=0.026). Male gametocytes had a mean estimated circulation time of 2.7 days (95% CI 1.5\u20133.9) compared to 5.1 days (95% CI 4.1\u20136.1) for female gametocytes. Exploratory mosquito feeding assays showed successful sporadic mosquito infections. There were no serious adverse events or significant differences in the occurrence and severity of adverse events between study arms (p=0.49 and p=0.28).",

Apart from the direct health implications, malaria is a substantial contributor to ongoing poverty in affected countries. Recently, the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites has emerged as a global health concern. Both the recent gains in malaria control and concerns about artemisinin resistance have stimulated programs to eliminate malaria (<a href=\"#bib46\">World Health Organization, 2016</a>). Novel interventions may support malaria elimination efforts in endemic settings (<a href=\"#bib16\">Griffin et al., 2010</a>) that are further dependent on political and financial commitments to maximize coverage with currently available interventions and improve surveillance systems to optimize disease notification and treatment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Moonen et al., 2010</a>).",

Upon commitment, maturation of gametocytes takes place predominantly in the bone marrow, and requires 7 days (range 4\u201312) of development.\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Eichner et al., 2001</a>) Subsequently, mature gametocytes (parasites that are not associated with clinical disease) appear in the peripheral blood, where they may circulate for an average of 6 days (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eichner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bousema et al., 2010</a>).

After exposure to bites of a standard protocol of five <i>P. falciparum</i> infected mosquitoes, all participants developed parasitemia on days 6.5\u201312 post-challenge; peak parasite densities ranged from 1050 to 63113 <i>Pf</i>/mL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Due to asexual recrudescence in seven of the eight participants after a subcurative treatment (T1) with LD-PIP, a curative treatment (T2) had to be administered before day 21 post challenge. The median period between T1 and T2 was 9.1 (range of 7.7\u201311.7), 10.0 (range of 9.2\u201310.2), 4.7 (range of 2\u201310.7), and 2.5 (range of 1.5\u20135.0) days\u00a0for study arms LD-SP/SP, LD-SP/PIP, LD-PIP/PIP, and LD-PIP/SP, respectively. In participants receiving a subcurative LD-SP as T1, no recrudescent infection occurred and T2 was initiated on day 21 per protocol. One participant from treatment arm LD-PIP/PIP developed asexual recrudescence after T2, and received end treatment with atovaquone/proguanil on day 36. The remaining participants did not develop recrudescent infections after T2, and were treated with atovaquone/proguanil on day 42 as per protocol.",

The AUC of asexual parasitemia was statistically significantly associated with the AUC of gametocytemia (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.31, p=0.026), as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. The mean time-window between the first asexual parasites and the first appearance of gametocytes was 10.6 (SD\u00a0=\u00a00.65) days, see <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>. Membrane feeding experiments were performed as an exploratory objective, and confirmed infectivity of gametocytes in three mosquitoes from three study arms on days 25 (LD-PIP/SP and LD-SP/SP arms) and 31 (LD-SP/PIP arm) post-infection. Mean gametocyte densities at those time-points were 106 gametocytes/mL (SD\u00a0=\u00a0175), and 28 gametocytes/mL (SD\u00a0=\u00a047), respectively. Expressed as a proportion of all examined mosquitoes, 0.0002% (3/14400) of mosquitoes became infected in these exploratory assessments. Possible and probable related adverse events after challenge infection are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>. The most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, malaise, headache, fever, nausea, and chills. Grade three adverse events were reported in 14/16 (88%) participants, and were predominated by headache (n\u00a0=\u00a08), chills (n\u00a0=\u00a06), and nausea (n\u00a0=\u00a05). All possible and probable related adverse events resolved by the end of study. No serious adverse events occurred. The median number of adverse events was 20.5 per individual; the median number of adverse events with a grade three severity score was 1.5 per individual. There was no evidence for a difference between study arms in the occurrence of adverse events (p=0.49) or grade three adverse events (p=0.28).",

The timing of the first appearance of gametocytes suggests that a fraction of the first wave of asexual parasites commit to the production of male and female gametocytes. With the use of antimalarial drugs that attenuates asexual stage infections but leave (developing) gametocytes unaffected, we determined biologically plausible half-lives of male and female gametocytes, and show preliminary evidence of the potential of this model to complete the lifecycle of malaria in mosquito feeding assays.",

                        "text": "Malaria elimination efforts require a thorough understanding of the transmissibility of infections. Gametocyte commitment occurs for a fraction of asexual parasites under regulation of the transcription factor AP2-G with the entire progeny of a sexually committed schizont forming either male or female gametocytes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kafsack et al., 2014</a>). Our findings, based on novel sex-specific gametocyte qRT-PCR, confirm earlier work from malariatherapy studies where gametocytes were first detected by microscopy at 9\u201311 days after asexual parasites (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ciuca et al., 1937</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Shute and Maryon, 1951</a>). These data indicate very early gametocyte commitment and are in line with our earlier observations that Pfs16 mRNA, the earliest gametocyte transcript, is detectable at the moment of peak parasitemia in CHMI models (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneider et al., 2004</a>). This timing is highly relevant for understanding gametocyte transmission biology. The circulation of mature gametocytes has not been reported in previous CHMI trials using curative regimens of chloroquine, artemether-lumefantrine, or atovaqoune-proguanil, and our data illustrate the differential impact of antimalarial drugs on developing gametocytes. Once treatment is initiated, gametocyte production ceases abruptly (in the case of artemisinins), remains unaffected, or may even be stimulated under drug pressure as suggested for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and piperaquine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Butcher, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adjalley et al., 2011</a>). In our study, we aimed for a protracted low density of asexual parasitemia demonstrating that early abrogation of asexual infections by both sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and piperaquine permits successful mature gametocyte development. SP has long been associated with a rapid appearance of gametocytes that is too early to be explained by de novo gametocyte production upon drug pressure and has thus been hypothesized to reflect an efflux of sequestered gametocytes upon treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butcher, 1997</a>). Evidence for the permissiveness of piperaquine to (developing) gametocytes is more recent (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pasay et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Farid et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adjalley et al., 2011</a>). In the current study, group sizes are limited and comparisons between treatment arms have to be interpreted with caution. CHMI studies are logistically challenging and the number of volunteers that can be monitored to ensure participant safety is an important consideration when defining the study size. Our sample size calculation was based on the optimistic assumption that the vast majority of volunteers would develop mature gametocytes; an assumption that was supported by the current data. With our limited study size, our findings indicate that none of the study drugs prevented the appearance of gametocytes after treatment, thereby suggesting limited or no effect of PIP and SP on developing or mature gametocytes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bolscher et al., 2015</a>). We hypothesized that slow acting drugs may promote the development of gametocytes (<a href=\"#bib24\">M\u00e9ndez et al., 2002</a>), potentially via microvesicles that are derived from infected erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nilsson et al., 2015</a>) and differences between drug regimens in the rate at which asexual parasites are cleared upon T1 and T2 would result in different gametocyte dynamics. Although our findings indicate highest gametocyte concentrations in the LD-PIP/SP arm, more observations and thus additional studies are needed to allow the construction of a model that allows a quantification of gametocyte commitment at different time-points during the study (e.g. prior to T1, during the phase of parasite recrudescence and following T2). One hypothesis would be similar gametocyte commitment in all arms after T1 but a more rapid release of gametocytes that accumulated in the bone marrow between T1 and T2.",

                        "text": "We present the novel evidence that both male and female gametocytes appear early, upon infection. Our findings suggest an earlier appearance of female gametocytes (18.8 days (SD 1.8) compared to male gametocytes 20.3 days (SD 1. 2)) and a longer circulation time of female gametocytes that is in line with previous estimates from naturally infected individuals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bousema et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciuca et al., 1937</a>). Whilst both male and female gametocytes are consistently detected at densities of 0.1 gametocyte/\u00b5L (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stone et al., 2017</a>), the highly abundant Pfs25 mRNA makes the female gametocyte qRT-PCR more sensitive than the male PfMGET qRT-PCR. Differences in gametocyte dynamics between male and female gametocytes should therefore be interpreted with caution. Gametocyte densities remained below the threshold of detection by microscopy throughout the study period and were strongly associated with the preceding densities of the asexual progenitors. Participants in the LD-PIP/SP study arm showed the highest gametocytes densities, and a mean female/male sex ratio of 4.1 (SD\u00a0=\u00a05.1), in line with gametocyte sex-ratios in natural infections (~3 to 5 females to one male) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ciuca et al., 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Delves et al., 2013</a>). We confirmed the infectivity of gametocytes in three mosquitoes from three study arms. The very low rate of infected mosquito corroborates observations from naturally acquired infections where mosquito infection becomes highly unlikely below 1000\u201310,000 gametocytes/mL (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2016</a>). The sporadic mosquito infections thus demonstrate that mature gametocytes in sex-ratios supportive of mosquito infections can be achieved in CHMI transmission models. Studies on the evaluation of TBIs will need a further optimized protocol aimed to achieve higher gametocyte densities by increasing duration and load of the asexual parasite burden. For the evaluation of gametocytocidal interventions in the CHMI transmission model, gametocyte densities should be sufficiently high to quantify an intervention-associated reduction in gametocyte appearance or gametocyte half-life. For the evaluation of interventions that reduce the transmissibility of gametocytes, higher mosquito infections should be achieved at proportions that allow the detection of meaningful reductions in mosquito infection rates in experimental arms. Low infectivity in membrane feeding assays may be overcome by achievement of higher gametocyte densities in the model, and the use of gametocyte concentration methods (<a href=\"#bib31\">Reuling et al., 2017</a>), or by direct skin feeding assays\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Bousema et al., 2012</a>).",

It has been hypothesized that the prolonged parasitemia under drug pressure increases gametocyte commitment (<a href=\"#bib48\">WWARN Gametocyte Study Group, 2016</a>). The duration of parasite multiplication between T1 and T2 was relatively short in this study (2\u20135 days) for subjects with recrudescent infections, and the contribution of drug pressure may thus have been limited.

All model fittings were carried out using the PROC NLMIXED procedure in SAS (Version 9, SAS Institute Inc) and included no covariates other than time (see <a href=\"#scode2\">Source code 2</a> for SAS code). The AUC was computed by GraphPad Prism 5 (USA) with the (X2-X1)*(Y1\u00a0+Y2)/2 formula (X\u00a0=\u00a0days post challenge; Y\u00a0=\u00a0gametocytes per mL (\u22655 gametocytes/mL)) as used repeatedly for each adjacent pair of points defining the curve; the total AUC was used.",

A suggestion only: it might be possible to take into account the non-independence between time-points and use all the data, by using a statistical time-series model with a lag from the asexual densities or a simple mechanistic model fitted to the data.

So in our analysis, despite the fact that the AUC may be higher in some individuals by shear chance (which the model captures in the error term of the linear predictor), the posterior probability that the AUC is highest in the LD-PIP/SP arm on average is still a very convincing 94.4% (if groups where identical, one would expect a posterior probability of about 1 / 4 = 25%).",

Reads were aligned to the <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome v3 (plasmoDB) with bowtie2 (sourceforge) and consensus sequences for dhps and dhfr genes were obtained with samtools. Read depth (coverage) was assessed using bedtools. With this approach, we determined dhfr/dhps mutations in our 3D7 parasites; only one mutated locus in the dhps gene was found (PfDHPS A437G), which is not associated with treatment failure as single mutation (Staedke et al. 2004). WGS analysis thus rules out sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance of the 3D7 lineage we used. Plasmepsin II/III duplication events are associated with piperaquine resistance (Witkowski et al., 2017) but were not found in the 3D7 WGS data. However, as the neighboring genes Plasmepsin I and IV have sequence similarities, unambiguous quantification is challenging and a final assessment would involve more specific targeting, e.g. by qPCR.",

It would be valuable to describe, if possible, the residuals around the model fits and comment on any heteroscedasticity. This is particularly important considering that a major finding of this report is that male gametocytes appear to be cleared more rapidly than female gametocytes. If in fact the gametocyte clearance profile is more complex (e.g. multiexponential) then the lower density male gametocytes may appear to be more rapidly eliminated whereas, in fact, the slower terminal phase of elimination is below the limit of accurate detection. A similar problem has bedevilled assessment of the pharmacokinetic properties of slowly eliminated antimalarials.",

We accept that this model, like all models, relies on assumptions and we have made this clearer in the Discussion. We have also plotted male and female gametocyte decay curves for all volunteers with &gt;. We observe that whilst individual gametocyte clearance lines appear to be parallel for some volunteers (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2), others show evidence for a faster disappearance of male gametocytes.",

There is no clear relationship between parasitemia densities and liver abnormalities, and it also seems unlikely to be directly related to anti-malarials due to variety of drugs used in CHMI. Similarly, the use of paracetamol does not support a clear relationship. Rather a combination of the above mentioned factors, and individual susceptibility may have triggered the observed abnormalities. The transient asymptomatic liver function test abnormalities are most likely directly related to the asexual parasitemia, and subsequent treatment. The exact mechanism of the transient organ injury during the malaria and its treatment is yet to be understood and ongoing work. We are currently reviewing all our CHMI data, including the many trials where treatment was initiated at lower parasite densities, and intend to write this up as a separate manuscript to describe the prevalence, severity and transient nature of liver function abnormalities upon controlled malaria infections.",
