Here, we report an alternative mechanism for entosis in human epithelial cells, driven by mitosis. Mitotic entosis is regulated by Cdc42, which controls mitotic morphology. Cdc42 depletion enhances mitotic deadhesion and rounding, and these biophysical changes, which depend on RhoA activation and are phenocopied by Rap1 inhibition, permit subsequent entosis. Mitotic entosis occurs constitutively in some human cancer cell lines and mitotic index correlates with cell cannibalism in primary human breast tumours. Adherent, wild-type cells can act efficiently as entotic hosts, suggesting that normal epithelia may engulf and kill aberrantly dividing neighbours. Finally, we report that Paclitaxel/taxol promotes mitotic rounding and subsequent entosis, revealing an unconventional activity of this drug. Together, our data uncover an intriguing link between cell division and cannibalism, of significance to both cancer and chemotherapy."

Here, we report an alternative mechanism for entosis in human epithelial cells, driven by mitosis. Mitotic entosis is regulated by Cdc42, which controls mitotic morphology. Cdc42 depletion enhances mitotic deadhesion and rounding, and these biophysical changes, which depend on RhoA activation and are phenocopied by Rap1 inhibition, permit subsequent entosis. Mitotic entosis occurs constitutively in some human cancer cell lines and mitotic index correlates with cell cannibalism in primary human breast tumours. Adherent, wild-type cells can act efficiently as entotic hosts, suggesting that normal epithelia may engulf and kill aberrantly dividing neighbours. Finally, we report that Paclitaxel/taxol promotes mitotic rounding and subsequent entosis, revealing an unconventional activity of this drug. Together, our data uncover an intriguing link between cell division and cannibalism, of significance to both cancer and chemotherapy."

The causes and mechanisms involved in this unusual process, which is also known as entosis, are not well understood and its relationship to cancer is complex. On one hand, cell cannibalism may promote cancer by providing nutrients for growing tumours and making it more likely that genetic errors will occur. On the other hand, this process may resist cancer by eliminating damaged cells."

Cells in the body are typically surrounded and supported by a mesh of proteins called the extracellular matrix. However, within a tumour, cancer cells can often begin to grow without being attached to the matrix, which means that cell cannibalism can occur. A protein called Cdc42 plays a part in how cells attach to each other and to the extracellular matrix, but the role of Cdc42 in controlling entosis had not been previously explored."

However, the experiments showed that removing Cdc42 from human cells grown in the laboratory had little effect on this method of entosis. Unexpectedly, though, the loss of Cdc42 did enable a different form of cell cannibalism in cells that remained attached to the extracellular matrix, which had not been seen before. This new cannibalism process is linked to cell division, with cells that are dividing or that have recently divided being consumed by neighbours. This form of cell cannibalism is more commonly seen in cancers where the cells divide a lot, and some chemotherapy drugs that interfere with cell division also increase the rate of cell cannibalism."

Durgan et al. suggest this allows the dividing cells to force their way inside other cells, the key first stage of entosis. Since cancer cells divide often, this form of cell cannibalism may lead to the cancer cells being destroyed by their healthy neighbours, in a form of \u201cassisted suicide\u201d. This reveals an unexpected link between cell division and cell cannibalism, which is relevant to both cancer and chemotherapy. Future work will explore whether entosis can be used to predict how a cancer will progress in a patient, or how they will respond to a given treatment."

Homotypic epithelial cell cannibalism can occur by entosis, an intriguing process through which one live and viable cell is completely engulfed by another, yielding a \u2018cell-in-cell\u2019 structure (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>). The vast majority of internalised, entotic cells are ultimately killed and digested by their hosts, through a mechanism involving non-canonical autophagy and lysosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yuan and Kroemer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>)."

On one hand, entotic cell killing can limit outgrowth through the elimination of internalised cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>), representing a possible means of tumour suppression. Conversely, entosis simultaneously promotes host cell survival and transformation, by providing valuable nutrients (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fais, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Krajcovic et al., 2013</a>) and driving genomic instability (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with these pro-tumorigenic effects, the frequency of entosis is found to increase with tumour grade (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>), and cell-in-cell formation correlates with poor patient outcome (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwegler et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schenker et al., 2017</a>), suggesting this process may be associated with tumour progression. Finally, entosis can mediate cancer cell competition (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>), allowing one population to preferentially engulf and kill another, and may therefore contribute to shaping tumour evolution. Together, these findings indicate that entosis can mediate both tumour suppressive and promoting effects (<a href=\"#bib30\">Krishna and Overholtzer, 2016</a>), but the overall impact of entotic cell cannibalism on tumour biology and progression remains to be fully understood (<a href=\"#bib11\">Durgan and Florey, 2015</a>)."

This process is known to be triggered by matrix deadhesion, which renders the cells unanchored and this contractile force unopposed.

Similarly, Rac1 can regulate myosin phosphorylation to modulate entotic cell competition (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>). Other Rho-family members seem likely to influence cell cannibalism, through effects on the actomyosin cytoskeleton, cell-cell contacts or cell-matrix adhesion, but their contributions have yet to be investigated. The present study was initiated to explore a possible role for Cdc42, a master regulator of epithelial cell biology (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Joberty et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jaffe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wallace et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roignot et al., 2013</a>).

We present our findings on the relationship between epithelial cell division and cannibalism and demonstrate its relevance to both human cancer and chemotherapy."

                                "text": "To assess a possible role in entosis, Cdc42 was depleted in 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells, using multiple distinct and non-overlapping RNAi reagents. All Cdc42-specific duplexes and hairpins yield a robust knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), and induce expected functional changes, such as disruption of adherens (AJ) and tight junction (TJ) maturation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wallace et al., 2010</a>). To initiate entosis, cells were cultured in suspension for 8 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013d</a>), inducing cell-in-cell formation among\u00a0~10% of control cells, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>). Surprisingly, despite clear effects on AJ maturation, Cdc42 depletion has no major impact on cell-in-cell formation under these conditions, suggesting that primordial junctions are sufficient to support entosis. Strikingly, however, we found instead that Cdc42 depletion promotes robust cell-in-cell formation in adherent culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e\u2013f</a>), in which entosis would not be expected to occur. This surprising phenotype is reproducible and statistically significant across all RNAi reagents tested, corresponding closely with knockdown efficiency (compare siCdc42.1/2), consistent with a specific, on-target effect of Cdc42. Furthermore, adherent cell-in-cell formation is also observed in Cdc42-depleted MCF7 breast epithelia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g\u2013i</a>), indicating that this process is consistent across multiple cell lines, derived from different tissues of origin. Together, these data reveal that Cdc42 does not play a significant role in conventional entosis, but unexpectedly controls a novel form of cell-in-cell formation among adherent cells."

                                "text": "The adherent cell-in-cell structures observed upon Cdc42 depletion morphologically resemble those formed through entosis. However, entosis is typically triggered by matrix detachment, occuring in suspension (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>), or during the early stages of adhesion (6\u20138 hr after plating) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). To determine whether adherent cell-in-cell formation otherwise bears the hallmarks of entosis, additional characteristics were analysed. Firstly, Cdc42 was co-depleted with \u03b1-catenin, a core junctional component that is indispensible for entosis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1j\u2013l</a>). \u03b1-catenin depletion yields profound AJ defects, and a corresponding reduction in cell-in-cell formation, in line with an entotic mechanism. Next, the involvement of actomyosin contractility was assessed, which drives suspension entosis downstream of RhoA/ROCK (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>). Inhibition of ROCK dramatically suppresses cell-in-cell formation among Cdc42-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1l</a>), like entosis under detached (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2014b</a>), semi-adherent (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wan et al., 2012</a>) or in vivo conditions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this, active, phospho-myosin (pS10-MLC2) is clearly enriched in the internalising cell tail (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1m</a>). Finally, entotic cell cannibalism characteristically involves non-canonical autophagy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>) and lysosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Krajcovic et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this mechanism, both LC3 (an autophagy protein) and LAMP1 (a lysosomal marker) are transiently recruited to the vacuoles of Cdc42-depleted cell-in-cell structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1n</a>). Taken together, these data reveal that entosis can indeed occur among adherent epithelial cells and suggest that a distinct mechanism must trigger cell-in-cell formation under these conditions."

Representative movies and stills are shown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). During every cell-in-cell event analysed, the inner cell penetrates its host either during, or shortly after, mitosis. Several permutations of this process were observed, with one or both daughters penetrating the same or different hosts, or one daughter invading the other and both entering an adherent neighbour (cell-in-cell-in-cell). To support these studies, fixed, adherent, entotic events were visualised at a mid-way point by IF/3D-correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). In each case, mitotic cells were observed internalising into adherent neighbours. These comprehensive imaging studies establish a clear relationship between cell division and cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that mitosis may drive entosis in adherent cell populations. To test this model more directly, Cdc42-depleted cells were arrested at the G2/M boundary using a Cdk1 inhibitor (RO-3306). Strikingly, inhibition of mitosis leads to a profound decrease in cell-in-cell formation in matrix-attached, but not detached conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). These data indicate that cell division drives adherent, but not suspension, entosis, highlighting two mechanistically distinct routes to epithelial cell cannibalism."

Control and Cdc42-depleted cells were labelled red or green, respectively, and\u00a0then reseeded to yield an equally mixed monolayer. Inner/outer cell identities were scored among the adherent, cell-in-cell structures formed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f\u2013g</a>). In almost all pairs, the inner cell is Cdc42-depleted. These cells penetrate control or knockdown neighbours with equal frequency, and the results are unchanged by dye reversal (data not shown). These findings establish that loss of Cdc42 specifically promotes internalisation, enabling a dividing cell to \u2018invade\u2019 into an adherent neighbour, while having no detectable effect on the host. Given that wild-type cells act efficiently as hosts, we can exclude the possibility that Cdc42-depletion promotes entosis by impairing cell-matrix contacts to \u2018mimic\u2019 deadhesion. To verify this further, Cdc42-depleted cells were mixed with wild-type cells expressing RFP-zyxin, an adhesome component (<a href=\"#bib23\">Horton et al., 2015</a>). Basal RFP-zyxin-positive foci are observed within entotic hosts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>), reinforcing the conclusion that the host cell can be fully matrix-adhered. Finally, we analysed the consequences of mitosis-induced entosis under adherent conditions. Cdc42-depleted 16HBE cell-in-cell structures were followed by timelapse microscopy and the fate of the internalised cell recorded (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i\u2013j</a>). As in suspension conditions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>), the majority of internalised cells die, by either non-apoptotic or apoptotic means, within the entotic vacuole, establishing mitotic entosis in adherent cells as a means of epithelial cell cannibalism. Together, our data demonstrate that loss of Cdc42 permits a dividing cell to \u2018invade\u2019 into a neighbour by entosis, and clarify that the host cell can be wild-type and fully adherent. These findings raise the intriguing concept that normal, adherent epithelia may engulf, kill and digest dividing neighbours under certain conditions."

                                "text": "Our findings support a model in which epithelial Cdc42 inhibits entosis among mitotic cells. To investigate the possible mitotic functions of Cdc42, dividing cells were analysed by flow cytometry and microscopy. No gross defects in cell cycle progression are detected upon Cdc42-depletion by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). However, imaging studies reveal significant morphological changes during cell division. Control and Cdc42-depleted cells were visualised during the different phases of mitosis, in live cells stained for plasma membrane and DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Consistent with previous reports, we observed that Cdc42-depletion can misorient the plane of division (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jaffe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roignot et al., 2013</a>), while control cells divide parallel to the substrate, the plane of division in Cdc42-depleted cells is randomised. However, this phenotype seems unlikely to drive cell-in-cell formation, as aPKC-depletion promotes similar spindle misorientation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Durgan et al., 2011</a>), with no detectable effect on entosis under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, we also identified additional, unanticipated changes in mitotic morphology upon Cdc42-depletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b\u2013d</a>). Like other polarised epithelia (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reinsch and Karsenti, 1994</a>), WT-16HBE cells bulge as they enter prometaphase, but retain both cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts throughout mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, upper panel). In contrast, from prometaphase onwards, Cdc42-depleted cells exhibit reduced spreading, associated with a diminished adhesive surface area, and dramatic rounding, a closely related phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marchesi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, lower panel). These morphological changes can be quantified by calculating height/length, as a measure of cell spreading (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), and circularity, as a score of roundness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Across multiple reagents and experiments, Cdc42-depletion consistently and significantly augments mitotic deadhesion and rounding. These data uncover a novel role for Cdc42 in controlling mitotic morphology in polarised epithelial cells."

RhoA, another of the major small GTPases, has been implicated in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chircop, 2014</a>), mitotic rounding (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maddox and Burridge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Matthews et al., 2012</a>) and cell-in-cell formation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>) through previous studies. To investigate a possible role here, the spatiotemporal activation of RhoA was assessed using a FRET-based biosensor, RhoA-FLARE (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pertz et al., 2006</a>). Control or Cdc42-depleted 16HBE cells expressing the RhoA biosensor were subjected to live confocal imaging for CFP (FRET donor) and YFP (FRET acceptor), as well as DNA (Hoechst) and DIC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>); RhoA activation is proportional to the FRET/CFP emission ratio. While control 16HBE cells show a relatively low level of RhoA activity during metaphase, a clear enrichment of active RhoA is frequently observed at the metaphase cortex among Cdc42-depleted cells (37%; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Related to this, an increase in cortical actin can also be observed among Cdc42-depleted, metaphase cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Together, these data indicate that Cdc42 constrains mitotic RhoA activation in polarised epithelial cells, and accordingly, that loss of Cdc42 permits overactivation of cortical RhoA during metaphase."

Although mitotic cells do remain somewhat rounded in the presence of this toxin, inhibition of the Rho proteins has a clear impact on mitotic spreading, yielding a significant increase in basal area, and thus partially reversing the effect of Cdc42-depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). These data are consistent with previous studies that have implicated RhoA activity in mitotic cell retraction, rigidity and rounding (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maddox and Burridge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Matthews et al., 2012</a>), along with its targets ROCK (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maddox and Burridge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Meyer et al., 2011</a>) and myosin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matthews et al., 2012</a>). To explore this observation further, live Cdc42-depleted cells were treated with additional pathway inhibitors, and suppression of ROCK (Y-27632) or myosin (blebbistatin) activity similarly rescued mitotic cell spreading in Cdc42-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>). Together, these data indicate that aberrant activation of a Rho/ROCK/myosin cascade during mitosis can drive enhanced retraction and rounding. Based on these findings, we would predict that RhoA inhibition may also suppress mitotic entosis upon Cdc42-depletion, by reverting these induced changes in mitotic morphology. Unfortunately, it is not possible to demonstrate this link unambiguously, because RhoA inhibition will block entotic cell-in-cell formation regardless of its trigger, due to downstream effects on myosin contractility (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>) and actin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Purvanov et al., 2014</a>). As such, while we can clearly implicate RhoA in both mitotic rounding and cell-in-cell formation, we cannot definitively dissect the process of mitotic entosis further by targeting RhoA alone."

                                "text": "As an alternative approach to determine whether mitotic deadhesion and rounding is sufficient to drive entosis, mitotic morphology was manipulated through other means. Rap1 is yet another small GTPase, which, importantly here, is known to control post-mitotic spreading (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lancaster et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this, we confirm that expression of DN-Rap1 reduces spreading and increases rounding during 16HBE division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013d</a>). Strikingly, inhibition of Rap1, like Cdc42, also induces adherent entosis, albeit at a lower level. Cell-in-cell formation among Rap1-inhibited cells occurs during or shortly after mitosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e\u2013g</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>) and is inhibited by G2 arrest (Cdk1i). These data are consistent with a model in which enhanced mitotic deadhesion and rounding drive subsequent cell-in-cell formation. In light of these data, we next asked whether mitosis might promote entosis by simply providing an alternative route to matrix deadhesion in one cell of the pair (the dividing, internalised cell). To address this, we tested whether detached, interphase cells can similarly penetrate matrix-attached hosts. WT-16HBE cells were labelled green, detached and then either overlaid onto wild-type monolayers (adherent hosts) or maintained in suspension for 8 hr; the resulting cell-in-cell structures were scored (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5h\u2013i</a>). Strikingly, while detached interphase cells undergo efficient entosis in suspension (~8%), penetration of adherent hosts is barely detectable. These data indicate that simple loss of matrix-attachment is insufficient to drive penetration of an adherent host. Consistent with this, entosis has not been observed among 16HBE-monolayers upon depletion of matrix-adhesion proteins (e.g. \u03b21-integrin; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these data indicate that mitotic deadhesion and rounding, which can be augmented by inhibition of Cdc42 or Rap1, can drive the entotic penetration of an adherent host cell, while matrix-detachment during interphase cannot. These findings infer important mechanistic differences between cell cannibalism under detached and adherent conditions. We conclude that the distinctive biophysical changes associated with mitosis are an essential requirement when entosis occurs in an adherent host."

                                "text": "Given that tumour cells are prone to undergo deregulated division and that mitotic rounding is proposed to be of relevance in cancer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cadart et al., 2014</a>), we hypothesised that transformed cells may undergo mitotic entosis constitutively. To test this, adherent cancer cell lines were examined by fixed and live microscopy. Interestingly, MCF7 (breast) and HCT116 (colorectal) cells were found to undergo adherent entosis under basal conditions. Importantly, cell-in-cell formation is coincident with cell division, as shown by timelapse microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media8\">8</a>), and is largely dependent on progression through mitosis, in both 2D and 3D culture (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c\u2013d</a>). These data indicate that mitosis drives constitutive adherent entosis in certain transformed tumour cell lines and raise the interesting possibility that cell division may promote cell cannibalism in the proliferative environment of a tumour. To investigate this more directly, a tissue microarray of 75 human breast invasive ductal carcinomas was analysed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e\u2013g</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Each tumour core was stained for DNA,\u00a0\u03b2-catenin and p-Histone-H3 (pS10; a mitotic marker), and\u00a0then imaged in full and scored for mitotic activity (mitotic cells/core) and entosis (cell-in-cell structures/core). 31/75 ductal carcinomas were positive for entosis, and among these, mitotic activity positively correlates with cell-in-cell formation, with statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>). These data are consistent with the notion that mitosis may drive entotic cell-in-cell formation in vivo. During conventional entosis, the inner cell is typically killed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wan et al., 2012</a>), while the outer cell is rendered prone to division failure (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). To determine whether similar anti- and pro-tumorigenic consequences accompany mitotic entosis among adherent cancer cells, the outcomes were followed by timelapse and IF/confocal microscopy. Similar to suspension conditions, cell death is the predominant fate for internalised cells following mitotic entosis, which can occur by either non-apoptotic and apoptotic means (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h\u2013i</a>). Host cell division failure was also analysed by scoring for multinucleation. Again, similar to suspension entosis, host cells are more frequently multi-nucleated than surrounding single cells, suggesting that abscission can be disrupted by entosis in adherent, as well as matrix-detached, conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6j\u2013k</a>). Together, these data establish that mitosis-induced entosis occurs basally in adherent cancer cell lines and human breast carcinomas. Mitosis-induced entosis can drive inner cell killing, a potentially tumour suppressive effect, but also promotes host cell multi-nucleation, a route to tumour-promoting genomic instability. These findings uncover an intriguing relationship between cell division and cannibalism, of potential functional significance during tumour development and evolution."

                                "text": "Many cancers are treated chemotherapeutically with taxanes (e.g. Paclitaxel), which can induce prometaphase arrest, multipolar division and cell death (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zasadil et al., 2014</a>). As such, we hypothesised that taxane treatment might influence cell cannibalism by modulating mitotic entosis. To test this, 16HBE cells were incubated in the presence or absence of taxol, then imaged by timelapse or IF/confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). As expected, taxol treatment increases mitotic index under these conditions, arresting the cells in prometaphase (in contrast to Cdk1i which arrests at G2/M, inhibiting entry into mitosis). Importantly, taxol treatment also consistently increases cell-in-cell formation under these conditions, in line with an induction of mitotic entosis. This effect can be phenocopied with additional drugs that inhibit mitotic progression through different mechanisms, including nocodazole (microtubule assembly inhibitor) and STLC (mitotic kinesin inhibitor), suggesting that entosis occurs as a consequence of prometaphase arrest rather than microtubule stabilisation. Strikingly, we also find that taxol, nocodazole and STLC significantly enhance mitotic deadhesion and rounding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d\u2013f</a>), thus independently supporting the model that changes in mitotic morphology are closely associated with adherent cell-in-cell formation. To investigate whether taxane-induced cell cannibalism may be of chemotherapeutic significance, MCF7 breast cancer cells were examined. In both cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7g\u2013h</a>) and mouse xenograft models (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i\u2013l</a>), 24 hr taxol treatment promotes a significant increase in mitotic index, and a corresponding induction of cell-in-cell formation, consistent with mitosis-induced entosis. Notably, as taxol is reported to inhibit MCF7 entosis in suspension (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xia et al., 2014</a>), these data further suggest that the mechanisms of detached versus adherent cell-in-cell formation are quite distinct. Together, our findings establish that taxane treatment enhances mitotic deadhesion and rounding and promotes cell cannibalism through entosis, and reinforce the conclusion that changes in mitotic morphology can drive adherent entosis. Moreover, these findings uncover some intriguing and unconventional new effects of taxane treatment, of potential chemotherapeutic interest."

Entosis is a form of homotypic epithelial cell cannibalism that is typically triggered by matrix-deadhesion, and which proceeds through junction formation and the generation of actomyosin contractility, culminating in cell engulfment and killing (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>). This process is regulated at various stages by Rho-family small GTPases, which govern the cytoskeletal and junctional components upon which entosis depends (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Purvanov et al., 2014</a>)."

Surprisingly, despite its well-documented control of the cytoskeleton, polarity and epithelial junctions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</a>), Cdc42 has little effect on entosis among cells cultured in suspension. Unexpectedly, however, we found that loss of Cdc42 can in fact promote robust cell-in-cell formation among adherent cells. This result was very surprising, because entosis is not expected to occur under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>), but, this process otherwise bears its hallmarks, involving cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), polarised actomyosin (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>), autophagy proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florey et al., 2011</a>) and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Krajcovic et al., 2013</a>). Notably, some similar, adherent engulfment events have been noted previously (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abreu and Sealy, 2012</a>), and in the present study, we clarify that entosis can indeed occur among matrix-attached cells, and define the associated mechanism."

However, our data are not consistent with this model. Firstly, control monolayers can efficiently internalise Cdc42-depleted neighbours, demonstrating that entotic hosts can be wild-type and therefore fully adherent. Secondly, neither enzymatic deadhesion, nor depletion of \u03b21-integrin, is sufficient to drive one population of cells to penetrate surrounding adherent neighbours. Together, these data indicate that general changes in matrix-binding are unlikely to fully account for adherent entosis."

We have also found little evidence to support a role for aPKC as a Cdc42 effector during adherent entosis, likely excluding mechanisms involving the polarity complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Joberty et al., 2000</a>), such as junctional remodelling (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wallace et al., 2010</a>), spindle orientation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Durgan et al., 2011</a>), or control of the metaphase cortex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rosa et al., 2015</a>). Instead, we have discovered an additional role for Cdc42 in regulating mitotic morphology, consistent with previous observations in NRK (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>) and HeLa (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mitsushima et al., 2009</a>) cells. Upon Cdc42 depletion, mitotic deadhesion and rounding are significantly enhanced. These phenotypes are associated with a prominent increase in cortical RhoA activity, and can be reverted by inhibition of RhoA, or its downstream effectors ROCK and myosin, consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maddox and Burridge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Matthews et al., 2012</a>). We conclude that Cdc42 plays a novel role in the regulation of mitotic morphology in polarised epithelial cells, in a RhoA/ROCK/myosin-dependent manner. It is interesting to note that this Rho-dependent signalling axis is also required for entosis among suspension cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that some interesting mechanistic parallels exist between these alternative routes to cell cannibalism."

Putting together the data from these diverse conditions, we conclude that the distinctive biophysical changes associated with mitotic deadhesion and rounding may uniquely enable a dividing cell to penetrate an adherent epithelium, by which it is ultimately cannibalised.

Regardless of the triggering mechanism, entosis promotes both inner cell death and outer cell nutrient gain and multi-nucleation, with the potential to confer both anti- and pro-tumorigenic effects."

Each case was represented by duplicate formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cores, each with a diameter of 1 mm and a thickness of 5 \u03bcm. The array was baked at 55\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, deparaffinised in xylene (2 \u00d7 10 min washes, RT) and rehydrated through sequential washes (2 \u00d7 100% EtOH, 1 \u00d7 70% EtOH, 1 \u00d7 30% EtOH, 3x H2O; 5\u00a0min each at RT). Antigens were retrieved by boiling in 1x citrate buffer (Vector Labs) for 20\u00a0min, then cooled back to RT. Blocking (45\u00a0min, RT) and antibody incubations were performed in TBS-T/5% BSA/0.1M Glycine; TBS-T was used for washes. Antibodies and mounting conditions are stated above (see IF), with primaries incubated 4\u00b0C/overnight, secondaries at RT/45\u00a0min and DAPI at RT/10\u00a0min. The array was stained for: (1) \u03b2-catenin, to visualise adherens junctions (where present), (2) p-Histone H3 (S10), a marker of mitosis, and (3) DAPI to visualise nuclear morphology. Each 1 mm core was imaged in whole by DIC and confocal microscopy, using a 40 \u00d7 1.4 NA objective and tiling a 6 \u00d7 6 grid. For each core, the number of p-Histone H3 (S10)-positive nuclei was counted as an indicator of mitotic activity, and the number of cell-in-cell structures scored as a measure of entosis."

When tumours reached a size of\u00a0~150 mm<sup>\u2227</sup>3, mice were treated with either vehicle, or 15 mg/kg taxol. Twenty-four\u00a0hour post-treatment, tumours were excised, formalin-fixed and 20\u00a0micron sections were prepared (these relatively thick sections permit complete visualisation of whole engulfed cell-in-cell structures). Sections were processed and stained as described for the TMA, and analysed by DIC and IF/confocal (\u03b2-catenin, p-HH3/DNA). To account for tumour heterogeneity, five well-separated fields of view (x/y) were captured from each of three distinct sections per tumour (z; from the top, middle, bottom) using a 40 \u00d7 1.4 NA objective. The average number of pHH3-positive cells was scored per FOV, per section. The total number of cell-in-cell structures in each section was scored."

To date, entosis has generally been observed when cells are grown in suspension. In contrast, Durgan et al. now document circumstances when substrate-adherent cells undergo entosis. They show that this is associated with mitosis, when either Cdc42 or Rap1 signaling are perturbed, maneuvers that promote deadhesion and cell rounding. Further, they show evidence that this process may occur in tumors, and can be promoted by chemotherapeutic agents that target microtubules or mitotic kinesins."

This result is surprising because until now entosis had been thought to occur only in cells that have lost matrix attachment. Furthermore, the authors found that mitotic deadhesion and rounding drives entosis. Consequently, a dominant-negative form of Rap1, a small GTPase that promotes cell spreading, also drives entosis. Lastly, the authors showed that cell-in-cell structures occur in human breast tumors using a tissue array and that taxol treatment drives cell deadhesion and rounding, which promotes entosis \u2013 a previously unreported function of the drug."

The relevance of mitotic entosis to the ability of cells to metastasize, escape the immune system, or die would be useful to know, therefore data suggesting its role in cancer would make the story more exciting and compelling. The studies in established cancer cells in culture are not all that convincing, given that the dependence for this activity would not happen on glass. Using organoids made from wild type or cancer tissue would give a more convincing platform to see if mitotic entosis occurs at a higher rate in cancer. Furthermore, the data from the cores is hard to interpret and correlative. From your previous studies, it seems that mitosis can occur after entosis. Were these tumors treated with taxol?

If so, cells that move in Rho-dependent mechanism, such as many cancer cells could also be affected. Therefore, they need to clearly define the base mechanism for this activity.</i>"

To address this important point, we have undertaken a FRET-based analysis of spatiotemporal RhoA signalling, in the presence and absence of Cdc42, as outlined above (reviewer 1, response 1). These experiments indicate that loss of Cdc42 permits overactivation of cortical RhoA during mitosis, which is accompanied by an enrichment of actin at the metaphase cortex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-C</a>). Building on these findings, we went on to show that the effects of Cdc42 depletion can be reverted by inhibition RhoA, or its downstream effectors, ROCK and myosin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-E</a>). Together, these data develop a model in which loss of Cdc42 permits the overactivation of a RhoA/ROCK/myosin cascade, which drives enhanced mitotic deadhesion and rounding and subsequent entosis. Notably, we find that loss of adhesion during interphase is insufficient to drive entotic penetration of an adherent host cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Similarly, we have found that interphase activation of myosin phosphorylation, through depletion of MYPT1, is also insufficient to drive adherent entosis (data not shown). As such, we believe this Cdc42-regulated RhoA/ROCK/myosin cascade, and its effects on entosis, are intimately linked to mitosis."

As noted by the reviewer, loss of Par6B/aPKC did not phenocopy Cdc42-depletion in this context, even though these proteins so often function together. This finding helps to exclude certain mechanisms as being sufficient to trigger mitotic entosis, such as disruption of junction formation, spindle orientation or control of the metaphase cortex."

We then quantify the associated defect in junction formation, to confirm a functional loss of the protein(s), and as requested, show graphically that there is no detectable entosis observed among aPKC-depleted cells under adherent conditions, across multiple independent experiments."

We believe the key difference between Cdk1i versus taxol/nocodazole/STLC in this context lies with the timing of cell cycle arrest. Cdk1 inhibition arrests cells at the G2/M transition, thereby inhibiting mitotic deadhesion and rounding as well as consequent entosis. Taxol, nocodazole and STLC, on the other hand, arrest cells in prometaphase, during which they do deadhere and round; indeed all 3 of these drugs actually enhance these morphological changes. Consistent with our model of mitotic entosis, these drugs also promote associated cell-in-cell formation.
